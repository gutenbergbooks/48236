<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>
<hr class="tb1" />
<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was while engaged in the preparation of a book&mdash;still
unfinished&mdash;on the Sway of Friendship in the
World’s Forces, that I came upon facts concerning
the primitive rite of covenanting by the inter-transfusion
of blood, which induced me to turn aside from
my other studies, in order to pursue investigations in
this direction.</p>

<p class="indent">Having an engagement to deliver a series of lectures
before the Summer School of Hebrew, under Professor
W. R. Harper, of Chicago, at the buildings of the
Episcopal Divinity School, in Philadelphia, I decided
to make this rite and its linkings the theme of that
series; and I delivered three lectures, accordingly,
June 16-18, 1885.</p>

<p class="indent">The interest manifested in the subject by those who
heard the Lectures, as well as the importance of the
theme itself, has seemed sufficient to warrant its
presentation to a larger public. In this publishing,
the form of the original Lectures has, for convenience
sake, been adhered to; although some considerable
additions to the text, in the way of illustrative facts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
have been made, since the delivery of the Lectures;
while other similar material is given in an Appendix.</p>

<p class="indent">From the very freshness of the subject itself, there
was added difficulty in gathering the material for its
illustration and exposition. So far as I could learn,
no one had gone over the ground before me, in this
particular line of research; hence the various items
essential to a fair statement of the case must be
searched for through many diverse volumes of travel
and of history and of archæological compilation, with
only here and there an incidental disclosure in return.
Yet, each new discovery opened the way for other
discoveries beyond; and even after the Lectures, in
their present form, were already in type, I gained
many fresh facts, which I wish had been earlier available
to me. Indeed, I may say that no portion of the
volume is of more importance than the Appendix;
where are added facts and reasonings bearing directly
on well-nigh every main point of the original Lectures.</p>

<p class="indent">There is cause for just surprise that the chief facts
of this entire subject have been so generally overlooked,
in all the theological discussions, and in all
the physio-sociological researches, of the earlier and
the later times. Yet this only furnishes another illustration
of the inevitably cramping influence of a pre-conceived
fixed theory,&mdash;to which all the ascertained
facts must be conformed,&mdash;in any attempt at thorough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
and impartial scientific investigation. It would seem
to be because of such cramping, that no one of the
modern students of myth and folk-lore, of primitive
ideas and customs, and of man’s origin and history,
has brought into their true prominence, if indeed he
has even noticed them in passing, the universally dominating
primitive convictions: that the blood is the life;
that the heart, as the blood-fountain, is the very soul of
every personality; that blood-transfer is soul-transfer;
that blood-sharing, human, or divine-human, secures
an inter-union of natures; and that a union of the
human nature with the divine is the highest ultimate
attainment reached out after by the most primitive, as
well as by the most enlightened, mind of humanity.</p>

<p class="indent">Certainly, the collation of facts comprised in this
volume grew out of no pre-conceived theory on the
part of its author. Whatever theory shows itself in
their present arrangement, is simply that which the
facts themselves have seemed to enforce and establish,
in their consecutive disclosure.</p>

<p class="indent">I should have been glad to take much more time for
the study of this theme, and for the re-arranging of
its material, before its presentation to the public; but,
with the pressure of other work upon me, the choice
was between hurrying it out in its present shape, and
postponing it indefinitely. All things considered, I
chose the former alternative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">In the prosecution of my investigations, I acknowledge
kindly aid from Professor Dr. <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Georg Ebers</span>,
Principal Sir William Muir, Dr. Yung Wing, Dean
E. T. Bartlett, Professors Doctors John P. Peters and
J. G. Lansing, the Rev. Dr. M. H. Bixby, Drs. D. G.
Brinton and Charles W. Dulles, the Rev. Messrs. R. M.
Luther and Chester Holcombe, and Mr. E. A. Barber;
in addition to constant and valuable assistance from Mr.
John T. Napier, to whom I am particularly indebted
for the philological comparisons in the Oriental field,
including the Egyptian, the Arabic, and the Hebrew.</p>

<p class="indent">At the best, my work in this volume is only tentative
and suggestive. Its chief value is likely to be in its
stimulating of others to fuller and more satisfactory
research in the field here brought to notice. Sufficient,
however, is certainly shown, to indicate that the
realm of true Biblical theology is as yet by no means
thoroughly explored.</p>

<h3 class="no-break"><a name="lec1_1" id="lec1_1"></a>1. SOURCES OF BIBLE STUDY.</h3>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Those</span> who are most familiar with the Bible, and
who have already given most time to its study, have
largest desire and largest expectation of more knowledge
through its farther study. And, more and more,
Bible study has come to include very much that is
outside of the Bible.</p>

<p class="indent">For a long time, the outside study of the Bible was
directed chiefly to the languages in which the Bible
was written, and to the archæology and the manners
and customs of what are commonly known as the
Lands of the Bible. Nor are these well-worked fields,
by any means, yet exhausted. More still remains to
be gleaned from them, each and all, than has been
gathered thence by all searchers in their varied lore.
But, latterly, it has been realized, that, while the Bible
is an Oriental book, written primarily for Orientals,
and therefore to be understood only through an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
understanding of Oriental modes of thought and
speech, it is also a record of God’s revelation to the
whole human race; hence, its inspired pages are to
receive illumination from all disclosures of the primitive
characteristics and customs of that race, everywhere.
Not alone those who insist on the belief that
there was a gradual development of the race from a
barbarous beginning, but those also who believe that
man started on a higher plane, and in his degradation
retained perverted vestiges of God’s original revelation
to him, are finding profit in the study of primitive
myths, and of aboriginal religious rites and ceremonies,
all the world over. Here, also, what has been
already gained, is but an earnest of what will yet be
compassed in the realm of truest biblical research.</p>


<h3><a name="lec1_2" id="lec1_2"></a>2. AN ANCIENT SEMITIC RITE.</h3>

<p class="indent">One of these primitive rites, which is deserving of
more attention than it has yet received, as throwing
light on many important phases of Bible teaching, is
the rite of blood-covenanting: a form of mutual
covenanting, by which two persons enter into the
closest, the most enduring, and the most sacred of
compacts, as friends and brothers, or as more than
brothers, through the inter-commingling of their
blood, by means of its mutual tasting, or of its inter-transfusion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
This rite is still observed in the unchanging
East; and there are historic traces of it,
from time immemorial, in every quarter of the globe;
yet it has been strangely overlooked by biblical
critics and biblical commentators generally, in these
later centuries.</p>

<p class="indent">In bringing this rite of the covenant of blood into
new prominence, it may be well for me to tell of it as
it was described to me by an intelligent native Syrian,
who saw it consummated in a village at the base of
the mountains of Lebanon; and then to add evidences
of its wide-spread existence in the East and elsewhere,
in earlier and in later times.</p>

<p class="indent">It was two young men, who were to enter into this
covenant. They had known each other, and had been
intimate, for years; but now they were to become
brother-friends, in the covenant of blood. Their relatives
and neighbors were called together, in the open
place before the village fountain, to witness the sealing
compact. The young men publicly announced their
purpose, and their reasons for it. Their declarations
were written down, in duplicate,&mdash;one paper for each
friend,&mdash;and signed by themselves and by several witnesses.
One of the friends took a sharp lancet, and
opened a vein in the other’s arm. Into the opening
thus made, he inserted a quill, through which he
sucked the living blood. The lancet-blade was carefully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
wiped on one of the duplicate covenant-papers,
and then it was taken by the other friend, who made
a like incision in its first user’s arm, and drank his
blood through the quill, wiping the blade on the
duplicate covenant-record. The two friends declared
together: “We are brothers in a covenant made
before God: who deceiveth the other, him will God
deceive.” Each blood-marked covenant-record, was
then folded carefully, to be sewed up in a small
leathern case, or amulet, about an inch square; to be
worn thenceforward by one of the covenant-brothers,
suspended about the neck, or bound upon the arm, in
token of the indissoluble relation.</p>

<p class="indent">The compact thus made, is called, <i>M’âhadat ed-Dam</i>
(<span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">معاهدة الدم</span>), the “Covenant of Blood.” The two
persons thus conjoined, are, <i>Akhwat el-M’âhadah</i>
(<span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">اخوة المعاهدة</span>), “Brothers of the Covenant.” The
rite itself is recognized, in Syria, as one of the very
old customs of the land, as <i>’âdah qadeemeh</i> (<span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">عادة قديمة</span>)
“a primitive rite.” There are many forms of covenanting
in Syria, but this is the extremest and most
sacred of them all. As it is the inter-commingling of
very lives, nothing can transcend it. It forms a tie,
or a union, which cannot be dissolved. In marriage,
divorce is a possibility: not so in the covenant of
blood. Although now comparatively rare, in view
of its responsibilities and of its indissolubleness, this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
covenant is sometimes entered into by confidential
partners in business, or by fellow-travelers; again, by
robbers on the road&mdash;who would themselves rest fearlessly
on its obligations, and who could be rested on
within its limits, however untrustworthy they or their
fellows might be to any other compact. Yet, again, it
is the chosen compact of loving friends; of those who
are drawn to it only by mutual love and trust.</p>

<p class="indent">This covenant is commonly between two persons of
the same religion&mdash;Muhammadans, Druzes, or Nazarenes;
yet it has been known between two persons of
different religions;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and in such a case it would be
held as a closer tie than that of birth<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> or sect. He
who has entered into this compact with another, counts
himself the possessor of a double life; for his friend,
whose blood he has shared, is ready to lay down his
life with him, or for him.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Hence the leathern case,
or <i>Bayt hejâb</i> (<span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">بيت حجاب</span>) “House of the amulet,”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
containing the record of the covenant (<i>’uhdah</i>, <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">عهدة</span>),
is counted a proud badge of honor, by one who
possesses it; and he has an added sense of security,
because he will not be alone when he falleth.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p class="indent">I have received personal testimony from native
Syrians, concerning the observance of this rite in
Damascus, in Aleppo, in Hâsbayya, in Abayh, along
the road between Tyre and Sidon, and among the
Koords resident in Salehayyah. All the Syrians who
have been my informants, are at one concerning the
traditional extreme antiquity of this rite, and its exceptional
force and sacredness.</p>

<p class="indent">In view of the Oriental method of evidencing the
closest possible affection and confidence, by the sucking
of the loved one’s blood, there would seem to be
more than a coincidence in the fact, that the Arabic
words for friendship, for affection, for blood, and for
leech, or blood-sucker, are but variations from a common
root.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> <i>’Alaqa</i> (<span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">علق</span>) means “to love,” “to
adhere,” “to feed.” <i>’Alaq</i> (<span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">علق</span>), in the singular,
means “love,” “friendship,” “attachment,” “blood.”
As the plural of <i>’alaqa</i> (<span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">علقة</span>), <i>’alaq</i> means “leeches,”
or “blood-suckers.” The truest friend clings like a
leech, and draws blood in order to the sharing thereby
of his friend’s life and nature.</p>

<p class="indent">A native Syrian, who had traveled extensively in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the East, and who was familiar with the covenant of
blood in its more common form, as already described,
told me of a practice somewhat akin to it, whereby a
bandit-chieftain would pledge his men to implicit and
unqualified, life-surrendering fidelity to himself; or,
whereby a conspirator against the government would
bind, in advance, to his plans, his fellow conspirators,&mdash;by
a ceremony known as <i>Sharb el-’ahd</i> (<span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">شرب العهد</span>)
“Drinking the covenant.” The methods of such covenanting
are various; but they are all of the nature of
tests of obedience and of endurance. They sometimes
include licking a heated iron with the tongue,
or gashing the tongue, or swallowing pounded glass or
other dangerous potions; but, in all cases, the idea
seems to be, that the life of the one covenanting is, by
this covenant, devoted&mdash;surrendered as it were&mdash;to
the one with whom he covenants; and the rite is
uniformly accompanied with a solemn and an imprecatory
appeal to God, as witnessing and guarding
the compact.</p>

<p class="indent">Dr. J. G. <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wetzstein</span>, a German scholar, diplomat,
and traveler, who has given much study to the peoples
east of the Jordan, makes reference to the binding
force and the profound obligation of the covenants of
brotherhood, in that portion of the East; although
he gives no description of the methods of the covenant-rite.
Speaking of two Bed´ween&mdash;Habbâs and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Hosayn&mdash;who had been “brothered” (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">verbrüdert</i>), he
explains by saying: “We must by this [term] understand
the Covenant of Brotherhood<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
(<i>Chuwwat el-Ahĕd</i> [<span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">خوة العهد</span>]),
which is in use to-day not only among
the Hadari [the Villagers], but also among the
Bed´ween; and is indeed of pre-Muhammadan origin.
The brother [in such a covenant] must guard the
[other] brother from treachery, and [must] succor
him in peril. So far as may be necessary, the one
must provide for the wants of the other; and the survivor
has weighty obligations in behalf of the family
of the one deceased.” Then, as showing how completely
the idea of a common life in the lives of two
friends thus covenanted&mdash;if, indeed, they have become
sharers of the same blood&mdash;sways the Oriental mind,
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wetzstein</span> adds: “The marriage of a man and woman
between whom this covenant exists, is held to be
<em>incest</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p class="indent">There are, indeed, various evidences that the tie of
blood-covenanting is reckoned, in the East, even a closer
tie than that of natural descent; that a “friend” by this
tie is nearer and is dearer, “sticketh closer,” than a
“brother” by birth. We, in the West, are accustomed
to say, that “blood is thicker than water”; but the
Arabs have the idea that blood is thicker than milk,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
than a mother’s milk. With them, any two children
nourished at the same breast are called “milk-brothers,”<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
or “sucking brothers”;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and the tie between
such is very strong. A boy and a girl in this relation
cannot marry, even though by birth they had no family
relationship. Among even the more bigoted of the
Druzes, a Druze girl who is a “sucking sister” of a
Nazarene boy is allowed a sister’s privileges with him.
He can see her uncovered face, even to the time of
her marriage. But, the Arabs hold that brothers in
the covenant of blood are closer than brothers at a
common breast; that those who have tasted each
other’s blood are in a surer covenant than those who
have tasted the same milk together; that “blood-lickers,”<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
as the blood-brothers are sometimes called, are
more truly one, than “milk-brothers,” or “sucking
brothers”; that, indeed, blood is thicker than milk, as
well as thicker than water.</p>

<p class="indent">This distinction it is which seems to be referred to
in a citation from the Arabic poet El-A’asha, by the
Arabic lexicographer Qamus, which has been a puzzle
to Lane, and Freytag, and others.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Lane’s translation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of the passage is: “Two foster-brothers by the
sucking of the breast of one mother, swore together
by dark blood, into which they dipped their hands,
that they should not ever become separated.” In other
words, two milk-brothers became blood-brothers, by
interlocking their hands under their own blood, in the
covenant of blood-friendship. They had been closely
inter-linked before; now they were as one; for blood is
thicker than milk. The oneness of nature which comes
of sharing the same blood, by its inter-transfusion, is
rightly deemed, by the Arabs, completer than the oneness
of nature which comes of sharing the same milk;
or even than that which comes through having blood
from a common source, by natural descent.</p>

<h3><a name="lec1_3" id="lec1_3"></a>3. THE PRIMITIVE RITE IN AFRICA.</h3>

<p class="indent">Travelers in the heart of Africa, also, report the
covenant of “blood-brotherhood,” or of “strong-friendship,”
as in vogue among various African tribes; although,
naturally retaining less of primitive sacredness
there than among Semites. The rite is, in some cases,
observed after the manner of the Syrians, by the contracting
parties tasting each other’s blood; while, in
other cases, it is performed by the inter-transfusion of
blood between the two.</p>

<p class="indent">The first mention which I find of it, in the writings
of modern travelers in Africa, is by the lamented hero-missionary,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Dr. Livingstone. He calls the rite <i>Kasendi</i>.
It was in the region of Lake Dilolo, at the watershed
between the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic, in July,
1854, that he made blood-friendship, vicariously, with
Queen Manenko, of the Balonda tribes.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> She was
represented, in this ceremony, by her husband, the
ebony “Prince Consort”; while Livingstone’s representative
was one of his Makololo attendants. Woman’s
right to rule&mdash;when she has the right&mdash;seems to
be as clearly recognized in Central Africa, to-day, as it
was in Ethiopia in the days of Candace, or in Sheba
in the days of Balkees.</p>

<p class="indent">Describing the ceremony, Livingstone says:<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> “It is
accomplished thus: The hands of the parties are
joined (in this case Pitsane and Sambanza were the
parties engaged). Small incisions are made on the
clasped hands, on the pits of the stomach of each,
and on the right cheeks and foreheads. A small
quantity of blood is taken off from these points, in
both parties, by means of a stalk of grass. The
blood from one person is put into a pot of beer,
and that of the second into another; each then
drinks the other’s blood, and they are supposed to
become perpetual friends, or relations. During the
drinking of the beer, some of the party continue beating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the ground with short clubs, and utter sentences
by way of ratifying the treaty. The men belonging
to each [principal’s party], then finish the beer. The
principals in the performance of ‘Kasendi’ are henceforth
considered blood-relations, and are bound to disclose
to each other any impending evil. If Sekeletu
[chief of Pitsane’s tribe&mdash;the Makololo&mdash;] should resolve
to attack the Balonda [Sambanza’s&mdash;or, more
properly, Manenko’s&mdash;people], Pitsane would be under
obligation to give Sambanza warning to escape; and so,
on the other side. [The ceremony concluded in this
case] they now presented each other with the most
valuable presents they had to bestow. Sambanza
walked off with Pitsane’s suit of green baize faced
with red, which had been made in Loanda; and Pitsane,
besides abundant supplies of food, obtained two
shells [of as great value, in regions far from the sea,
‘as the Lord Mayor’s badge is in London,’] similar to
that [one, which] I had received from Shinte [the uncle
of Manenko].”<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Of the binding force of this covenant, Livingstone
says farther: “On one occasion I became blood-relation
to a young woman by accident. She had a large
cartilaginous tumor between the bones of the forearm,
which as it gradually enlarged, so distended the
muscles as to render her unable to work. She applied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to me to excise it. I requested her to bring her
husband, if he were willing to have the operation performed;
and while removing the tumor, one of the
small arteries squirted some blood into my eye. She
remarked, when I was wiping the blood out of it,
‘You were a friend before; now you are a blood-relation;
and when you pass this way always send me word,
that I may cook food for you.’”<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Of the influence of these inter-tribal blood-friendships,
in Central Africa, Dr. Livingstone speaks most
favorably. Their primitive character is made the
more probable, in view of the fact that he first found
them existing in a region where, in his opinion, the
dress and household utensils of the people are identical
with those which are represented on the monuments
of ancient Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Although it is within our
own generation that this mode of covenanting in the
region referred to, has been made familiar to us, the
rite itself is of old, elsewhere if not, indeed, there; as
other travelers following in the track of Livingstone
have noted and reported.</p>

<p class="indent">Commander Cameron, who, while in charge of the
Livingstone Search Expedition, was the first European
traveler to cross the whole breadth of the African
continent in its central latitudes, gives several illustrations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of the observance of this rite. In June, 1874, at
the westward of Lake Tanganyika, Syde, a guide of
Cameron, entered into this covenant of blood with
Pakwanya, a local chief.</p>

<p class="indent">“After a certain amount of palaver,” says Cameron,
“Syde and Pakwanya exchanged presents, much to
the advantage of the former [for in the East, the
person of higher rank is supposed to give the more
costly gifts in any such exchange]; more especially
[in this case] as he [Syde] borrowed the beads of me
and afterward forgot to repay me. Pakwanya then
performed a tune on his harmonium, or whatever the
instrument [which he had] might be called, and the
business of fraternizing was proceeded with. Pakwanya’s
head man acted as his sponsor, and one of my
askari assumed the like office for Syde.</p>

<p class="indent">“The first operation consisted of making an incision
on each of their right wrists, just sufficient to draw
blood; a little of which was scraped off and smeared
on the other’s cut; after which gunpowder was rubbed
in [thereby securing a permanent token on the arm].
The concluding part of the ceremony was performed
by Pakwanya’s sponsor holding a sword resting on
his shoulder, while he who acted [as sponsor] for
Syde went through the motions of sharpening a knife
upon it. Both sponsors meanwhile made a speech,
calling down imprecations on Pakwanya and all his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
relations, past, present, and future, and prayed that
their graves might be defiled by pigs if he broke the
brotherhood in word, thought, or deed. The same
form having been gone through with, [with] respect
to Syde, the sponsors changing duties, the brother-making
was complete.”<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Concerning the origin of this rite, in this region,
Cameron says: “This custom of ‘making brothers,’
I believe to be really of Semitic origin, and to have
been introduced into Africa by the heathen Arabs
before the days of Mohammed; and this idea is
strengthened by the fact that when the first traders
from Zanzibar crossed the Tanganyika, the ceremony
was unknown [so far as those traders knew] to the
westward of that lake.”<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Cameron was, of course,
unaware of the world-wide prevalence of this rite;
but his suggestion that its particular form just here
had a Semitic origin, receives support in a peculiar
difference noted between the Asiatic and the African
ceremonies.</p>

<p class="indent">It will be remembered, that, among the Syrians, the
blood of the covenant is taken into the mouth, and
the record of the covenant is bound upon the arm.
The Africans, not fully appreciating the force of a
written record, are in the habit of reversing this order,
according to Cameron’s account. Describing the rite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
as observed between his men and the natives, on the
Luama River, he says: “The brotherhood business
having been completed [by putting the blood from
one party on to the arm of the other], some pen and
ink marks were made on a piece of paper, which,
together with a charge of powder, was put into a
kettleful of water. All hands then drank of the
decoction, the natives being told that it was a very
great medicine.”<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> That was “drinking the covenant”<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
with a vengeance; nor is it difficult to see how this
idea originated.</p>

<p class="indent">The gallant and adventurous Henry M. Stanley
also reports this rite of “blood-brotherhood,” or of
“strong friendship,” in the story of his romantic experiences
in the wilds of Africa. On numerous occasions
the observance of this rite was a means of protection
and relief to Stanley. One of its more notable illustrations
was in his compact with “Mirambo, the warrior
chief of Western Unyamwezi;”<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> whose leadership in
warfare Stanley compares to that of both Frederick
the Great<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and Napoleon.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p class="indent">It was during his first journey in pursuit of Livingstone,
in 1871, that Stanley first encountered the forces
of Mirambo, and was worsted in the conflict.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Writing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of him, after his second expedition, Stanley describes
Mirambo, as “the ‘Mars of Africa,’ who since 1871
has made his name feared by both native and foreigner
from Usui to Urori, and from Uvinza to Ugogo, a
country embracing 90,000 square miles; who, from
the village chieftainship over Uyoweh, has made for
himself a name as well known as that of Mtesa
throughout the eastern half of Equatorial Africa; a
household word from Nyangwé to Zanzibar, and the
theme of many a song of the bards of Unyamwezi,
Ukimbu, Ukonongo, Uzinja, and Uvinza.”<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> For a
time, during his second exploring expedition, Stanley
was inclined to avoid Mirambo, but becoming “impressed
with his ubiquitous powers,”<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> he decided to
meet him, and if possible make “strong friendship”
with him. They came together, first, at Serombo,
April 22, 1876. Mirambo “quite captivated” Stanley.
“He was a thorough African <em>gentleman</em> in appearance....
A handsome, regular-featured, mild-voiced,
soft-spoken man, with what one might call a ‘meek’
demeanor; very generous and open-handed;” his eyes
having “the steady, calm gaze of a master.”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The African hero and the heroic American agreed to
“make strong friendship” with each other. Stanley
thus describes the ceremony: “Manwa Sera [Stanley’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
‘chief captain’] was requested to seal our friendship
by performing the ceremony of blood-brotherhood between
Mirambo and myself. Having caused us to sit
fronting each other on a straw-carpet, he made an incision
in each of our right legs, from which he extracted
blood, and inter-changing it, he exclaimed aloud: ‘If
either of you break this brotherhood now established
between you, may the lion devour him, the serpent
poison him, bitterness be in his food, his friends desert
him, his gun burst in his hands and wound him, and
everything that is bad do wrong to him until death.’”<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
The same blood now flowed in the veins of both Stanley
and Mirambo. They were friends and brothers in
a sacred covenant; life for life. At the conclusion of
the covenant, they exchanged gifts; as the customary
ratification, or accompaniment, of the compact. They
even vied with each other in proofs of their unselfish
fidelity, in this new covenant of friendship.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Again and again, before and after this incident,
Stanley entered into the covenant of blood-brotherhood
with representative Africans; in some instances
by the opening of his own veins; at other times by
allowing one of his personal escort to bleed for him.
In January, 1875, a “great magic doctor of Vinyata”
came to Stanley’s tent to pay a friendly visit, “bringing
with him a fine, fat ox as a peace offering.” After
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
an exchange of gifts, says Stanley, “he entreated me to
go through the process of blood-brotherhood, which
I underwent with all the ceremonious gravity of a
pagan.”<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Three months later, in April, 1875, when Stanley
found himself and his party in the treacherous toils
of Shekka, the King of Bumbireh, he made several
vain attempts to “induce Shekka, with gifts, to go
through the process of blood-brotherhood.” Stanley’s
second captain, Safeni, was the adroit, but unsuccessful,
agent in the negotiations. “Go frankly and smilingly,
Safeni, up to Shekka, on the top of that hill,” said
Stanley, “and offer him these three fundo of beads,
and ask him to exchange blood with you.” But the
wily king was not to be dissuaded from his warlike
purposes in that way. “Safeni returned. Shekka
had refused the pledge of peace.”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> His desire was to
take blood, if at all, without any exchange.</p>

<p class="indent">After still another three months, in July, 1875, Stanley,
at Refuge Island, reports better success in securing
peace and friendship through blood-giving and
blood-receiving. “Through the influence of young
Lukanjah&mdash;the cousin of the King of Ukerewé”&mdash;he
says, “the natives of the mainland had been induced
to exchange their churlish disposition for one of cordial
welcome; and the process of blood-brotherhood had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
been formally gone through [with], between Manwa
Sera, on my part, and Kijaju, King of Komeh, and the
King of Itawagumba, on the other part.”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p class="indent">It was at “Kampunzu, in the district of Uvinza,
where dwell the true aborigines of the forest country,”&mdash;a
people whom Stanley afterwards found to be
cannibals&mdash;that this rite was once more observed between
the explorers and the natives. “Blood-brotherhood
being considered as a pledge of good-will and
peace,” says Stanley, “Frank Pocock [a young Englishman
who was an attendant of Stanley] and the
chief [of Kampunzu] went through the ordeal; and
we interchanged presents”&mdash;as is the custom in the
observance of this rite.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p class="indent">At the island of Mpika, on the Livingstone River,
in December, 1876, there was another bright episode
in Stanley’s course of travel, through this mode of
sealing friendship. Disease had been making sad
havoc in Stanley’s party. He had been compelled to
fight his way along through a region of cannibals.
While he was halting for a breakfast on the river
bank over against Mpika, an attack on him was preparing
by the excited inhabitants of the island. Just
then his scouts captured a native trading party of men
and women who were returning to Mpika, from inland;
and to them his interpreters made clear his pacific
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
intentions. “By means of these people,” he says, “we
succeeded in checking the warlike demonstrations of
the islanders, and in finally persuading them to make
blood-brotherhood; after which we invited canoes to
come and receive [these hostages] their friends. As
they hesitated to do so, we embarked them in our own
boat, and conveyed them across to the island. The
news then spread quickly along the whole length of
the island that we were friends, and as we resumed
our journey, crowds from the shore cried out to us,
‘<em>Mwendé Ki-vuké-vuké</em>’ (‘Go in peace!’)”<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Once more it was at the conclusion of a bloody
conflict, in the district of Vinya-Njara, just below
Mpika Island, that peace was sealed by blood. When
practical victory was on Stanley’s side, at the cost of
four of his men killed, and thirteen more of them
wounded, then he sought this means of amity. “With
the aid of our interpreters,” he says, “we communicated
our terms, viz., that we would occupy Vinya-Njara,
and retain all the canoes unless they made
peace. We also informed them that we had one
prisoner, who would be surrendered to them if they
availed themselves of our offer of peace: that we had
suffered heavily, and they had also suffered; that war
was an evil which wise men avoided; that if they
came with two canoes with their chiefs, two canoes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
with our chiefs should meet them in mid-stream, and
make blood-brotherhood; and that on that condition
some of their canoes should be restored, and we would
purchase the rest.” The natives took time for the
considering of this proposition, and then accepted it.
“On the 22nd of December, the ceremony of blood-brotherhood
having been formally concluded, in mid-river,
between Safeni and the chief of Vinya-Njara,”
continues Stanley, “our captive, and fifteen canoes, were
returned, and twenty-three canoes were retained by us
for a satisfactory equivalent; and thus our desperate
struggle terminated.”<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p class="indent">On the Livingstone, just below the Equator, in
February, 1877, Stanley’s party was facing starvation,
having been for some time “unable to purchase food,
or indeed [to] approach a settlement for any amicable
purpose.” The explorers came to look at “each other
as fated victims of protracted famine, or [of] the rage
of savages, like those of Mangala.” “We continued
our journey,” goes on the record, “though grievously
hungry, past Bwena and Inguba, doing our utmost to
induce the staring fishermen to communicate with us;
without any success. They became at once officiously
busy with guns, and dangerously active. We arrived
at Ikengo, and as we were almost despairing, we proceeded
to a small island opposite this settlement, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
prepared to encamp. Soon a canoe with seven men
came dashing across, and we prepared our moneys for
exhibition. They unhesitatingly advanced, and ran
their canoe alongside of us. We were rapturously
joyful, and returned them a most cordial welcome, as
the act was a most auspicious sign of confidence. We
were liberal, and the natives fearlessly accepted our
presents; and from this giving of gifts we proceeded
to seal this incipient friendship with our blood, with all
due ceremony.”<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> And by this transfusion of blood,
the starving were re-vivified, and the despairing were
given hope.</p>

<p class="indent">Twice, again, within a few weeks after this experience,
there was a call on Stanley of blood for blood,
in friendship’s compact. The people of Chumbiri welcomed
the travelers. “They readily subscribed to
all the requirements of friendship, blood-brotherhood,
and an exchange of a few small gifts.”<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Itsi, the king
of Ntamo, with several of his elders and a showy
escort, came out to meet Stanley; and there was a
friendly greeting on both sides. “They then broached
the subject of blood-brotherhood. We were willing,”
says Stanley, “but they wished to defer the ceremony
until they had first shown their friendly feelings to
us.” Thereupon gifts were exchanged, and the king
indicated his preference for a “big goat” of Stanley’s,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
as his benefaction&mdash;which, after some parleying, was
transferred to him. Then came the covenant-rite.
“The treaty with Itsi,” says Stanley, “was exceedingly
ceremonious, and involved the exchange of
charms. Itsi transferred to me for my protection
through life, a small gourdful of a curious powder,
which had rather a saline taste; and I delivered over
to him, as the white man’s charm against all evil, a
half-ounce vial of magnesia; further, a small scratch
in Frank’s arm, and another in Itsi’s arm, supplied
blood sufficient to unite us in one, and [by an] indivisible
bond of fraternity.”<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Four years after this experience of blood-covenanting,
by proxy, with young Itsi, Stanley found himself
again at Ntamo, or across the river from it; this time
in the interest of the International Association of the
Congo. Being short of food, he had sent out a party
of foragers, and was waiting their return with interest.
“During the absence of the food-hunters,” he says,
“we heard the drums of Ntamo, and [we] followed
with interested eyes the departure of two large canoes
from the landing-place, their ascent to the place
opposite, and their final crossing over towards us.
Then we knew that Ngalyema of Ntamo had condescended
to come and visit us. As soon as he arrived
I recognized him as the Itsi with whom, in 1877, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
had made blood-brotherhood [by proxy]. During
the four years that had elapsed, he had become a
great man.... He was now about thirty-four
years old, of well-built form, proud in his bearing,
covetous and grasping in disposition, and, like all
other lawless barbarians, prone to be cruel and sanguinary
whenever he might safely vent his evil humor.
Superstition had found in him an apt and docile pupil,
and fetishism held him as one of its most abject
slaves. This was the man in whose hands the destinies
of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Association Internationale du Congo</span> were
held, and upon whose graciousness depended our only
hope of being able to effect a peaceful lodgment on
the Upper Congo.” A pagan African was an African
pagan, even while the blood-brother of a European
Christian. Yet, the tie of blood-covenanting was the
strongest tie known in Central Africa. Frank Pocock,
whose covenant-blood flowed in Itsi’s veins, was
dead;<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> yet for his sake his master, Stanley, was welcomed
by Itsi as a brother; and in true Eastern
fashion he was invited to prove anew his continuing
faith by a fresh series of love-showing gifts. “My
brother being the supreme lord of Ntamo, as well as
the deepest-voiced and most arrogant rogue among
the whole tribe,” says Stanley, “first demanded the
two asses [which Stanley had with him], then a large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
mirror, which was succeeded by a splendid gold-embroidered
coat, jewelry, glass clasps, long brass chains,
a figured table-cloth, fifteen other pieces of fine cloth,
and a japanned tin box with a ‘Chubb’ lock. Finally,
gratified by such liberality, Ngalyema surrendered to
me his sceptre, which consisted of a long staff, banded
profusely with brass, and decorated with coils of brass
wire, which was to be carried by me and shown to all
men that I was the brother of Ngalyema [or, Itsi] of
Ntamo!”<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Some time after this, when trouble arose
between Stanley and Ngalyema, the former suggested
that perhaps it would be better to cancel their brotherhood.
“‘No, no, no,’ cried Ngalyema, anxiously; ‘our
brotherhood cannot be broken; our blood is now
one.’” Yet at this time Stanley’s brotherhood with
Ngalyema was only by the blood of his deceased
retainer, Frank Pocock.</p>

<p class="indent">More commonly, the rite of blood-friendship among
the African tribes seems to be by the inter-transfusion
of blood; but the ancient Syrian method is by no
means unknown on that continent. Stanley tells of
one crisis of hunger, among the cannibals of Rubunga,
when the hostility of the natives on the river bank
was averted by a shrewd display of proffered trinkets
from the boats of the expedition. “We raised our
anchor,” he says, “and with two strokes of the oars
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
had run our boat ashore; and, snatching a string or
two of cowries [or shell-money], I sprang on land,
followed by the coxswain Uledi, and in a second I had
seized the skinny hand of the old chief, and was
pressing it hard for joy. Warm-hearted Uledi, who
the moment before was breathing furious hate of all
savages, and of the procrastinating old chief in particular,
embraced him with a filial warmth. Young Saywa,
and Murabo, and Shumari, prompt as tinder upon all
occasions, grasped the lesser chiefs’ hands, and devoted
themselves with smiles and jovial frank bearing to
conquer the last remnants of savage sullenness, and
succeeded so well that, in an incredible short time, the
blood-brotherhood ceremony between the suddenly
formed friends was solemnly entered into, and the
irrevocable pact of peace and good will had been
accomplished.”<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Apparently unaware of the method of the ancient
Semitic rite, here found in a degraded form, Stanley
seems surprised at the mutual tasting of blood between
the contracting friends, in this instance. He says:
“Blood-brotherhood was a beastly cannibalistic ceremony
with these people, yet much sought after,&mdash;whether
for the satisfaction of their thirst for blood, or
that it involved an interchange of gifts, of which they
must needs reap the most benefit. After an incision
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
was made in each arm, both brothers bent their heads,
and the aborigine was observed to suck with the greatest
fervor; whether for love of blood or excess of friendship,
it would be difficult to say.”<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p class="indent">During his latest visit to Africa, in the Congo region,
Stanley had many another occasion to enter into the
covenant of blood with native chiefs, or to rest on that
covenant as before consummated. His every description
of the rite itself has its value, as illustrating the
varying forms and the essential unity of the ceremony
of blood-covenanting, the world over.</p>

<p class="indent">A reference has already been made<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> to Stanley’s
meeting, on this expedition, with Ngalyema, who,
under the name of Itsi, had entered into blood-brotherhood
with Frank Pocock, four years before. That
brotherhood by proxy had several severe strains, in
the progress of negotiations between Stanley and Ngalyema;
and after some eight months of these varying
experiences, it was urgently pressed on Stanley by the
chiefs of Kintamo (which is another name for Ntamo),
that he should personally covenant by blood with
Ngalyema, and so put an end to all danger of conflict
between them. To this Stanley assented, and the
record of the transaction is given accordingly, under
date of April 9, 1882: “Brotherhood with Ngalyema
was performed. We crossed arms; an incision
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
was made in each arm; some salt was placed on the
wound, and then a mutual rubbing took place, while
the great fetish man of Kintamo pronounced an inconceivable
number of curses on my head if ever I proved
false. Susi [Livingstone’s head man, now with Stanley],
not to be outdone by him, solicited the gods to
visit unheard-of atrocious vengeances on Ngalyema if
he dared to make the slightest breach in the sacred
brotherhood which made him and Bula Matari<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> one
and indivisible for ever.”<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p class="indent">In June, 1883, Stanley visited, by invitation, Mangombo,
the chief of Irebu, on the Upper Congo, and
became his blood-brother. Describing his landing at
this “Venice of the Congo,” he says: “Mangombo,
with a curious long staff, a fathom and a half in length,
having a small spade of brass at one end, much resembling
a baker’s cake-spade, stood in front. He was a
man probably sixty years old, but active and by no
means aged-looking, and he waited to greet me....
Generally the first day of acquaintance with
the Congo river tribes is devoted to chatting, sounding
one another’s principles, and getting at one another’s
ideas. The chief entertains his guest with gifts
of food, goats, beer, fish, &amp;c.; then, on the next day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
commences business and reciprocal exchange of gifts.
So it was at Irebu. Mangombo gave four hairy thin-tailed
sheep, ten glorious bunches of bananas, two
great pots of beer, and the usual accompaniments of
small stores. The next day we made blood-brotherhood.
The fetish-man pricked each of our right arms,
pressed the blood out; then, with a pinch of scrapings
from my gun stock, a little salt, a few dusty scrapings
from a long pod, dropped over the wounded arms,
... the black and white arms were mutually rubbed
together [for the inter-transfusion of the flowing
blood]. The fetish-man took the long pod in his
hand, and slightly touched our necks, our heads, our
arms, and our legs, muttering rapidly his litany of
incantations. What was left of the medicine Mangombo
and I carefully folded in a banana leaf [Was
this the ‘house of the amulet?’<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>], and we bore it
reverently between us to a banana grove close by, and
buried the dust out of sight. Mangombo, now my
brother, by solemn interchange of blood,&mdash;consecrated
to my service, as I was devoted in the sacred fetish
bond to his service,&mdash;revealed his trouble, and implored
my aid.”<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Yet again, Stanley “made friendship” with the
Bakuti, at Wangata, “after the customary forms of
blood-brotherhood”;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> similarly with two chiefs, Iuka
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and Mungawa, at Lukolela;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> with Miyongo of Usindi;<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
and with the chiefs of Bolombo;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> of Yambinga,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
of Mokulu,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> of Irungu,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> of Upoto,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> of Uranga;<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and
so all along his course of travel. One of the fullest
and most picturesque of his descriptions of this
rite, is in connection with its observance with a son
of the great chief of the Bangala, at Iboko; and the
main details of that description are worthy of reproduction
here.</p>

<p class="indent">The Bangala, or “the Ashantees of the Livingstone
River,” as Stanley characterizes them, are a strong
and a superior people, and they fought fiercely against
Stanley, when he was passing their country in 1877.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
“The senior chief, Mata Bwyki (lord of many guns),
was [now, in October, 1883,] an old grey-haired man,”
says Stanley, “of Herculean stature and breadth of
shoulder, with a large square face, and an altogether
massive head, out of which his solitary eye seemed to
glare with penetrative power. I should judge him to
be six feet, two inches, in height. He had a strong,
sonorous voice, which, when lifted to speak to his
tribe, was heard clearly several hundred yards off.
He was now probably between seventy-five and eighty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
years old.... He was not the tallest man, nor
the best looking, nor the sweetest-dispositioned man, I
had met in all Africa; but if the completeness and
perfection of the human figure, combining size with
strength, and proportion of body, limbs, and head,
with an expression of power in the face, be considered,
he must have been at one time the grandest type of
physical manhood to be found in Equatorial Africa.
As he stood before us on this day, we thought of him
as an ancient Milo, an aged Hercules, an old Samson&mdash;a
really grand looking old man. At his side were seven
tall sons, by different mothers, and although they were
stalwart men and boys, the whitened crown of Mata
Bwyki’s head rose by a couple of inches above the
highest head.”</p>

<p class="indent">Nearly two thousand persons assembled, at Iboko,
to witness the “palaver” that must precede a decision
to enter into “strong friendship.” At the place of
meeting, “mats of split rattan were spread in a large
semicircle around a row of curved and box stools, for
the principal chiefs. In the centre of the line, opposite
this, was left a space for myself and people,” continues
Stanley. “We had first to undergo the process of
steady and silent examination from nearly two thousand
pairs of eyes. Then, after Yumbila, the guide, had
detailed in his own manner, who we were, and what was
our mission up the great river; how we had built towns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
at many places, and made blood-brotherhood with the
chiefs of great districts, such as Irebu, Ukuti, Usindi,
Ngombé, Lukolela, Bolobo, Mswata, and Kintamo, he
urged upon them the pleasure it would be to me to
make a like compact, sealed with blood, with the great
chiefs of populous Iboko. He pictured the benefits
likely to accrue to Iboko, and Mata Bwyki in particular,
if a bond of brotherhood was made between two
chiefs like Mata Bwyki and Tandelay, [Stanley,] or as
he was known, Bula Matari.”</p>

<p class="indent">There was no prompt response to Stanley’s request
for strong friendship with the Bangala. There were
prejudices to be removed, and old memories to be
overborne; and Yumbila’s eloquence and tact were
put to their severest test, in the endeavor to bring
about a state of feeling that would make the covenant
of blood a possibility here. But the triumph was won.
“A forked palm branch was brought,” says Stanley.
“Kokoro, the heir [of Mata Bwyki], came forward,
seized it, and kneeled before me; as, drawing out his
short falchion, he cried, ‘Hold the other branch, Bula
Matari!’ I obeyed him, and lifting his hand he cleaved
the branch in two. ‘Thus,’ he said, ‘I declare my
wish to be your brother.’</p>

<p class="indent">“Then a fetish-man came forward with his lancets,
long pod, pinch of salt, and fresh green banana leaf.
He held the staff of Kokoro’s sword-bladed spear,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
while one of my rifles was brought from the steamer.
The shaft of the spear and the stock of the rifle were
then scraped on the leaf, a pinch of salt was dropped
on the wood, and finally a little dust from the long
pod was scraped on the curious mixture. Then, our
arms were crossed,&mdash;the white arm over the brown
arm,&mdash;and an incision was made in each; and over the
blood was dropped a few grains of the dusty compound;
and the white arm was rubbed over the brown
arm [in the intermingling of blood].”</p>

<p class="indent">“Now Mata Bwyki lifted his mighty form, and with
his long giant’s staff drove back the compressed
crowd, clearing a wide circle, and then roaring out in
his most magnificent style, leonine in its lung-force,
kingly in its effect: ‘People of Iboko! You by the
river side, and you of inland. Men of the Bangala,
listen to the words of Mata Bwyki. You see Tandelay
before you. His other name is Bula Matari. He
is the man with the many canoes, and has brought
back strange smoke-boats. He has come to see Mata
Bwyki. He has asked Mata Bwyki to be his friend.
Mata Bwyki has taken him by the hand, and has become
his blood-brother. Tandelay belongs to Iboko
now. He has become this day one of the Bangala.
O, Iboko! listen to the voice of Mata Bwyki.’ (I
thought they must have been incurably deaf, not to
have heard that voice). ‘Bula Matari and Mata Bwyki
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
are one to-day. We have joined hands. Hurt not
Bula Matari’s people; steal not from them; offend
them not. Bring food and sell to him at a fair price,
gently, kindly, and in peace; for he is my brother.
Hear you, ye people of Iboko&mdash;you by the river
side, and you of the interior?’</p>

<p class="indent">“‘We hear, Mata Bwyki!’ shouted the multitude.”<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
And the ceremony was ended.</p>

<p class="indent">A little later than this, Stanley, or Tandelay, or
Bula Matari, as the natives called him, was at Bumba,
and there again he exchanged blood in friendship.
“Myombi, the chief,” he says, “was easily persuaded
by Yumbila to make blood-brotherhood with me; and
for the fiftieth time my poor arm was scarified, and
my blood shed for the cause of civilization. Probably
one thousand people of both sexes looked on the
scene, wonderingly and strangely. A young branch
of a palm was cut, twisted, and a knot tied at each
end; the knots were dipped in wood ashes, and then
seized and held by each of us, while the medicine-man
practised his blood-letting art, and lanced us both,
until Myombi winced with pain; after which the
knotted branch was severed; and, in some incomprehensible
manner, I had become united forever to my
fiftieth brother; to whom I was under the obligation
of defending [him] against all foes until death.”<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The blood of a fair proportion of all the first families<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of Equatorial Africa now courses in Stanley’s
veins; and if ever there was an American citizen who
could appropriate to himself preeminently the national
motto, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">E pluribus unum</span>,” Stanley is the man.</p>

<p class="indent">The root-idea of this rite of blood-friendship seems
to include the belief, that the blood is the life of a
living being; not merely that the blood is <em>essential</em> to
life, but that, in a peculiar sense, it <em>is</em> life; that it
actually vivifies by its presence; and that by its passing
from one organism to another it carries and
imparts life. The inter-commingling of the blood of
two organisms is, therefore, according to this view,
equivalent to the inter-commingling of the lives, of the
personalities, of the natures, thus brought together;
so that there is, thereby and thenceforward, one life in
the two bodies, a common life between the two friends:
a thought which Aristotle recognizes in his citation of
the ancient “proverb”: “One soul [in two bodies],”<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
a proverb which has not lost its currency in any of the
centuries.</p>

<p class="indent">That the blood can retain its vivifying power whether
passing into another by way of the lips or by way of the
veins, is, on the face of it, no less plausible, than that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the administering of stimulants, tonics, nutriments,
nervines, or anæsthetics, hypodermically, may be
equally potent, in certain cases, with the more common
and normal method of seeking assimilation by the
process of digestion. That the blood of the living has
a peculiar vivifying force, in its transference from one
organism to another, is one of the clearly proven re-disclosures
of modern medical science; and this transference
of blood has been made to advantage by way of
the veins, of the stomach, of the intestines, of the tissue,
and even of the lungs&mdash;through dry-spraying.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Different methods of observing this primitive rite
of blood-covenanting are indicated in the legendary
lore of the Norseland peoples; and these methods, in
all their variety, give added proof of the ever underlying
idea of an inter-commingling of lives through
an inter-commingling of blood. Odin was the beneficent
god of light and knowledge, the promoter of
heroism, and the protector of sacred covenants, in the
mythology of the North. Lôké, or Lok, on the other
hand, was the discordant and corrupting divinity;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
symbolizing, in his personality, “sin, shrewdness,
deceitfulness, treachery, malice,” and other phases of
evil.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> In the poetic myths of the Norseland, it is
claimed that at the beginning Odin and Lôké were in
close union instead of being at variance;<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> just as the
Egyptian cosmogony made Osiris and Set in original
accord, although in subsequent hostility;<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and as the
Zoroastrians claimed that Ormuzd and Ahriman were
at one, before they were in conflict.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Odin and Lôké
are, indeed, said to have been, at one time, in the close
and sacred union of blood-friendship; having covenanted
in that union by mingling their blood in a bowl,
and drinking therefrom together.</p>

<p class="indent">The Elder Edda,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> or the earliest collection of Scandinavian
songs, makes reference to this confraternity of
Odin and Lôké. At a banquet of the gods, Lôké,
who had not been invited, found an entrance, and
there reproached his fellow divinities for their hostility
to him. Recalling the indissoluble tie of blood-friendship,
he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Father of Slaughter,
<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Odin, say,</div>
<div class="verse1">Rememberest not the former day,</div>
<div class="verse1">When ruddy in the goblet stood,</div>
<div class="verse1">For mutual drink, our blended blood?</div>
<div class="verse1">Rememberest not, thou then didst swear,</div>
<div class="verse1">The festive banquet ne’er to share,</div>
<div class="verse1">Unless thy brother Lok was there?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">In citing this illustration of the ancient rite, a
modern historian of chivalry has said: “Among barbarous
people [the barbarians of Europe] the fraternity
of arms [the sacred brotherhood of heroes] was established
by the horrid custom of the new brothers drinking
each other’s blood; but if this practice was barbarous,
nothing was farther from barbarism than the
sentiment which inspired it.”<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Another of the methods by which the rite of blood-friendship
was observed in the Norseland, was by
causing the blood of the two covenanting persons to
inter-flow from their pierced hands, while they lay
together underneath a lifted sod. The idea involved
seems to have been, the burial of the two individuals,
in their separate personal lives, and the intermingling
of those lives&mdash;by the intermingling of their blood&mdash;while
in their temporary grave; in order to their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
rising again with a common life<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>&mdash;one life, one soul, in
two bodies. Thus it is told, in one of the Icelandic
Sagas, of Thorstein, the heroic son of Viking, proffering
“foster-brotherhood,” or blood-friendship, to the
valiant Angantyr, Jarl of the Orkneys. “Then this
was resolved upon, and secured by firm pledges on
both sides. They opened a vein in the hollow of their
hands, crept beneath the sod, and there [with clasped
hands inter-blood-flowing] they solemnly swore that
each of them should avenge the other if any one
of them should be slain by weapons.” This was, in
fact, a three-fold covenant of blood; for King Bele,
who had just been in combat with Angantyr, was
already in blood-friendship with Thorstein.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The rite of blood-friendship, in one form and another
finds frequent mention in the Norseland Sagas. Thus, in
the Saga of Fridthjof the Bold, the son of Thorstein:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Champions twelve, too, had he&mdash;gray-haired, and princes in exploits,&mdash;</div>

<div class="verse1">Last on the champions’ bench, equal-aged with Fridthjof, a stripling</div>
<div class="verse1">Sat, like a rose among withered leaves; Bjorn called they the hero&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse1">Glad as a child, but firm like a man, and yet wise as a graybeard;</div>
<div class="verse1">Up with Fridthjof he’d grown; they had mingled blood with each other,</div>
<div class="verse1">Foster-brothers in Northman wise; and they swore to continue</div>
<div class="verse1">Steadfast in weal and woe, each other revenging in battle.”<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">A vestige of this primitive rite, coming down to us
through European channels, is found, as are so many
other traces of primitive rites, in the inherited folk-lore
of English-speaking children on both sides of the Atlantic.
An American clergyman’s wife said recently,
on this point: “I remember, that while I was a school-girl,
it was the custom, when one of our companions
pricked her finger, so that the blood came, for one or
another of us to say ‘Oh, let me suck the blood; then
we shall be friends.’” And that is but an illustration
of the outreaching after this indissoluble bond, on the
part of thirty generations of children of Norseland and
Anglo-Saxon stock, since the days of Fridthjof and
Bjorn; as that same yearning had been felt by those
of a hundred generations before that time.</p>


<h3><a name="lec1_5" id="lec1_5"></a>5. WORLD-WIDE SWEEP OF THE RITE.</h3>

<p class="indent">Concerning traces of the rite of blood-covenanting in
China, where there are to be found fewest resemblances
to the primitive customs of the Asiatic Semites, Dr.
Yung Wing, the eminent Chinese educationalist and
diplomat, gives me the following illustration: “In the
year 1674, when Kănhi was Emperor, of the present
dynasty, we find that the Buddhist priests of Shanlin
Monastery in Fuhkin Province had rebelled against
the authorities on account of persecution. In their
encounters with the troops, they fought against great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
odds, and were finally defeated and scattered in different
provinces, where they organized centres of the
Triad Society, which claims an antiquity dated as far
back as the Freemasons of the West. Five of these
priests fled to the province of Hakwong, and there,
Chin Kinnan, a member of the Hanlin College, who
was degraded from office by his enemies, joined them;
and it is said that they drank blood, and took the
oath of brotherhood, to stand by each other in life
or death.”</p>

<p class="indent">Along the southwestern border of the Chinese Empire,
in Burmah, this rite of blood-friendship is still
practiced; as may be seen from illustrations of it, which
are given in the Appendix of this work.</p>

<p class="indent">In his History of Madagascar, the Rev. William
Ellis, tells of this rite as he observed it in that island,
and as he learned of it from Borneo. He says:</p>

<p class="indent">“Another popular engagement in use among the Malagasy
is that of forming brotherhoods, which though
not peculiar to them, is one of the most remarkable
usages of the country.... Its object is to cement
two individuals in the bonds of most sacred friendship....
More than two may thus associate, if
they please; but the practice is usually limited to that
number, and rarely embraces more than three or four
individuals. It is called <i>fatridá</i>, <i>i. e.</i>, ‘dead blood,’
either because the oath is taken over the blood of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
fowl killed for the occasion, or because a small portion
of blood is drawn from each individual, when thus
pledging friendship, and drunk by those to whom
friendship is pledged, with execrations of vengeance
on each other in case of violating the sacred oath.
To obtain the blood, a slight incision is made in the
skin covering the centre of the bosom, significantly
called <i>ambavafo</i>, ‘the mouth of the heart.’ Allusion
is made to this, in the formula of this tragi-comical
ceremony.</p>

<p class="indent">“When two or more persons have agreed on forming
this bond of fraternity, a suitable place and hour
are determined upon, and some gunpowder and a ball
are brought, together with a small quantity of ginger,
a spear, and two particular kinds of grass. A fowl also
is procured; its head is nearly cut off; and it is left in
this state to continue bleeding during the ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p class="indent">“The parties then pronounce a long form of imprecation,
and [a] mutual vow, to this effect:&mdash;‘Should
either of us prove disloyal to the sovereign, or unfaithful
to each other,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> then perish the day, and perish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the night.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Awful is that, solemn is that, which we are
now both about to perform! O the mouth of the heart!&mdash;this
is to be cut, and we shall drink each other’s
blood. O this ball! O this powder! O this ginger!
O this fowl weltering in its blood!&mdash;it shall be killed,
it shall be put to excruciating agonies,&mdash;it shall be
killed by us, it shall be speared at this corner of the
hearth (Alakaforo or Adimizam, S. W.) And whoever
would seek to kill or injure us, to injure our
wives, or our children, to waste our money or our
property; or if either of us should seek to do what
would not be approved of by the king or by the
people; should one of us deceive the other by making
that which is unjust appear just; should one accuse
the other falsely; should either of us with our wives
and children be lost and reduced to slavery, (forbid
that such should be our lot!)&mdash;then, that good may
arise out of evil, we follow this custom of the people;
and we do it for the purpose of assisting one another
with our families, if lost in slavery, by whatever property
either of us may possess; for our wives are as one
to us, and each other’s children as his own,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> and our
riches as common property. O the mouth of the heart!
O the ball! O the powder! O the ginger! O this
miserable fowl weltering in its blood!&mdash;thy liver do we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
eat, thy liver do we eat. And should either of us
retract from the terms of this oath, let him instantly
become a fool, let him instantly become blind, let this
covenant prove a curse to him: let him not be a
human being: let there be no heir to inherit after him,
but let him be reduced, and float with the water never to
see its source; let him never obtain; what is out of
doors, may it never enter; and what is within may it
never go out; the little obtained, may he be deprived
of it;<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and let him never obtain justice from the sovereign
nor from the people! But if we keep and observe
this covenant, let these things bear witness.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> O mouth
of the heart! (repeating as before),&mdash;may this cause us
to live long and happy with our wives and our children;
may we be approved by the sovereign, and
beloved by the people; may we get money, may we
obtain property, cattle, &amp;c.; may we marry wives,
(<i>vady kely</i>); may we have good robes, and wear a
good piece of cloth on our bodies;<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> since, amidst our
toils and labor, these are the things we seek after.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
And this we do that we may with all fidelity assist
each other to the last.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">“The incision is then made, as already mentioned;
a small quantity of blood [is] extracted and drank by
the covenanting parties respectively, [they] saying as
they take it, ‘These are our last words, We will
be like rice and water;<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> in town they do not separate,
and in the fields they do not forsake one another; we
will be as the right and left hand of the body; if one
be injured, the other necessarily sympathizes and
suffers with it.’”<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Speaking of the terms and the influence of this covenant,
in Madagascar, Mr. Ellis says, that while absolute
community of all worldly possessions is not a literal
fact on the part of these blood-friends, “the engagement
involves a sort of moral obligation for one to
assist the other in every extremity.” “However devoid
of meaning,” he adds, “some part of the ceremony of
forming [this] brotherhood may appear, and whatever
indications of barbarity of feeling may appear in others,
it is less exceptionable than many [of the rites] that
prevail among the people.... So far as those
who have resided in the country have observed its
effects, they appear almost invariably to have been safe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to the community, and beneficial to the individuals by
whom the compact was formed.”</p>

<p class="indent">Yet again, this covenant of blood-friendship is found
in different parts of Borneo. In the days of Mr. Ellis,
the Rev. W. Medhurst, a missionary of the London
Missionary Society, in Java, described it, in reporting
a visit made to the Dayaks of Borneo, by one of his
assistants together with a missionary of the Rhenish
Missionary Society.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Telling of the kindly greeting given to these visitors
at a place called Golong, he says that the natives
wished “to establish a fraternal agreement with the
missionaries, on condition that the latter should teach
them the ways of God. The travelers replied, that if
the Dayaks became the disciples of Christ, they would
be constituted the brethren of Christ without any
formal compact. The Dayaks, however, insisted that
the travelers should enter into a compact [with them],
according to the custom of the country, by means of
blood. The missionaries were startled at this, thinking
that the Dayaks meant to murder them, and committed
themselves to their Heavenly Father, praying
that, whether living or dying, they might lie at the
feet of their Saviour. It appears, however, that it is
the custom of the Dayaks, when they enter into a
covenant, to draw a little blood from the arms of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
covenanting parties, and, having mixed it with water,
each to drink, in this way, the blood of the other.</p>

<p class="indent">“Mr. Barenstein [one of the missionaries] having
consented [for both] to the ceremony, they all took off
their coats, and two officers came forward with small
knives, to take a little blood out of the arm of each
of them [the two missionaries and two Dayak chiefs].
This being mixed together in four glasses of water,
they drank, severally, each from the glass of the other;
after which they joined hands and kissed. The people
then came forward, and made obeisance to the
missionaries, as the friends of the Dayak King, crying
out with loud voices, ‘Let us be friends and brethren
forever; and may God help the Dayaks to obtain the
knowledge of God from the missionaries!’ The two
chiefs then said, ‘Brethren, be not afraid to dwell with
us; for we will do you no harm; and if others wish
to hurt you, we will defend you with our life’s blood,
and die ourselves ere you be slain. God be witness,
and this whole assembly be witness, that this is true.’
Whereupon the whole company shouted, <em>Balaak!</em> or
‘Good,’ ‘Be it so.’”</p>

<p class="indent">Yet another method of observing this rite, is reported
from among the Kayans of Borneo; quite a
different people from the Dayaks. Its description is
from the narrative of Mr. Spenser St. John, as follows:
“Siñgauding [a Kayan chief] sent on board to request
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
me to become his brother, by going through the
sacred custom of imbibing each other’s blood. I say
imbibing, because it is either mixed with water and
drunk, or else is placed within a native cigar, and
drawn in with the smoke. I agreed to do so, and the
following day was fixed for the ceremony. It is called
<i>Berbiang</i> by the Kayans; <i>Bersabibah</i>, by the Borneans
[the Dayaks]. I landed with our party of Malays, and
after a preliminary talk, to allow the population to
assemble, the affair commenced.... Stripping
my left arm, Kum Lia took a small piece of wood,
shaped like a knife-blade, and, slightly piercing the
skin, brought blood to the surface; this he carefully
scraped off. Then one of my Malays drew blood in
the same way from Siñgauding; and, a small cigarette
being produced, the blood on the wooden blade was
spread on the tobacco. A chief then arose, and, walking
to an open place, looked forth upon the river, and
invoked their god and all the spirits of good and evil to
be witness of this tie of brotherhood. The cigarette
[blood-stained] was then lighted, and each of us took
several puffs [receiving each other’s blood by inhalation],
and the ceremony was over.”<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> This is a new method of
smoking the “pipe of peace”&mdash;or, the cigarette of inter-union!
Borneo, indeed, furnishes many illustrations
of primitive customs, both social and religious.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">One of the latest and most venturesome explorers
of North Borneo was the gallant and lamented Frank
Hatton, a son of the widely known international journalist,
Joseph Hatton. In a sketch of his son’s life-work,
the father says<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>: “His was the first white foot
in many of the hitherto unknown villages of Borneo;
in him many of the wild tribes saw the first white man....
Speaking the language of the natives, and possessing
that special faculty of kindly firmness so necessary
to the efficient control of uncivilized peoples, he journeyed
through the strange land not only unmolested,
but frequently carrying away tokens of native affection.
Several powerful chiefs made him their ‘blood-brother’;
and here and there the tribes prayed to him
as if he were a god.” It would seem from the description
of Mr. Hatton, that, in some instances, in Borneo,
the blood-covenanting is by the substitute blood of a
fowl held by the two parties to the covenant, while its
head is cut off by a third person; without any drinking
of each other’s blood by those who enter into the
covenant. Yet however this may be, the other method
still prevails there.</p>

<p class="indent">Another recent traveler in the Malay Archipelago,
who, also, is a trained and careful observer, tells of this
rite, as he found it in Timor, and other islands of that
region, among a people who represent the Malays,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the Papuan, and the Polynesian races. His description
is: “The ceremony of blood-brotherhood, ...
or the swearing of eternal friendship, is of an interesting
nature, and is celebrated often by fearful orgies
[excesses of the communion idea], especially when
friendship is being made between families, or tribes, or
kingdoms. The ceremony is the same in substance
whether between two individuals, or [between] large
companies. The contracting parties slash their arms,
and collect the blood into a bamboo, into which <i>kanipa</i>
(coarse gin) or <i>laru</i> (palm wine) is poured. Having
provided themselves with a small fig-tree (<i>halik</i>) they
adjourn to some retired spot, taking with them the
sword and spear from the <i>Luli</i> chamber [the sacred
room] of their own houses if between private individuals,
or from the <i>Uma-Luli</i> of their <i>suku</i> [the sacred
building of their village] if between large companies.
Planting there the fig-tree, flanked by the sacred sword
and spear, they hang on it a bamboo-receptacle, into
which&mdash;after pledging each other in a portion of the
mixed blood and gin&mdash;the remainder [of that mixture]
is poured. Then each swears, ‘If I be false, and be not
a true friend, may my blood issue from my mouth, ears,
nose, as it does from this bamboo!’&mdash;the bottom of the
receptacle being pricked at the same moment, to allow
the blood and gin to escape. The [blood-stained] tree
remains and grows as a witness of their contract.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Of the close and binding nature of this blood-compact,
among the Timorese, the observer goes on to say:
“It is one of their most sacred oaths, and [is] almost
never, I am told, violated; at least between individuals.”
As to its limitless force and scope, he adds: “One
brother [one of these brother-friends in the covenant
of blood] coming to another brother’s house, is in
every respect regarded as free [to do as he pleases],
and [is] as much at home as its owner. Nothing is
withheld from him; even his friend’s wife is not denied
him, and a child born of such a union would be recognized
by the husband as <em>his</em>; [for are not&mdash;as <em>they</em>
reason&mdash;these brother-friends of <em>one blood</em>&mdash;of one and
the same life?]”<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The covenant of blood-friendship has been noted
also among the native races of both North and South
America. A writer of three centuries ago, told of it
as among the aborigines of Yucatan. “When the Indians
of Pontonchan,” he said, “receive new friends
[covenant in a new friendship] ... as a proof of
[their] friendship, they [mutually, each], in the sight of
the friend, draw some blood ... from the tongue,
hand, or arm, or from some other part [of the body].”<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
And this ceremony is said to have formed “a compact
for life.”<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p class="indent">In Brazil, the Indians were said to have a rite of
brotherhood so close and sacred that, as in the case of
the Bed´ween beyond the Jordan,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> its covenanting parties
were counted as of one blood; so that marriage
between those thus linked would be deemed incestuous.
“There was a word in their language to express
a friend who was loved like a brother; it is written
<em>Atourrassap</em> [‘erroneously, beyond a doubt,’ adds
Southey, ‘because their speech is without the <em>r</em>’].
They who called each other by this name, had all
things in common; the tie was held to be as sacred as
that of consanguinity, and one could not marry the
daughter or sister of the other.”<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p class="indent">A similar tie of adopted brotherhood, or of close
and sacred friendship, is recognized among the North
American Indians. Writing of the Dakotas, or the
Sioux, Dr. Riggs, the veteran missionary and scholar,
says: “Where one Dakota takes another as his <i>koda</i>,
i. e., god, or friend, [Think of that, for sacredness of
union&mdash;‘god, or friend’!] they become brothers in each
other’s families, and are, as such, of course unable to
intermarry.”<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> And Burton, the famous traveler, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
made this same tribe a study, says of the Dakotas:
“They are fond of adoption, and of making brotherhoods
like the Africans [Burton is familiar with the
customs of African tribes]; and so strong is the tie
that marriage with the sister of an adopted brother is
within the prohibited degree.”<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Among the people of the Society Islands, and perhaps
also among those of other South Sea Islands,
the term <i>tayo</i> is applied to an attached personal
friend, in a peculiar relation of intimacy. The formal
ceremony of brotherhood, whereby one becomes the
tayo of another, in these islands, I have not found
described; but the closeness and sacredness of the
relation, as it is held by many of the natives, would
seem to indicate the inter-mingling of blood in the
covenanting, now or in former times. The early
missionaries to those islands, speaking of the prevalent
unchastity there, make this exception: “If a person is
a tayo of the husband, he must indulge in no liberties
with the sisters or the daughters, because they are
considered as <em>his own</em> sisters or daughters; and incest
is held in abhorrence by them; nor will any temptations
engage them to violate this bond of purity. The
wife, however, is excepted, and considered as common
property for the tayo.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Lieutenant Corner [a still
earlier voyager] also added, that a tayoship formed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
between different sexes put the most solemn barrier
against all personal liberties.”<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Here is evidenced that
same view of the absolute oneness of nature through
a oneness of blood, which shows itself among the
Semites of Syria,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> among the Malays of Timor,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> and
among the Indians of America.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p class="indent">And so this close and sacred covenant relation, this
rite of blood-friendship, this inter-oneness of life by an
inter-oneness of blood, shows itself in the primitive
East, and in the wild and pre-historic West; in the
frozen North, as in the torrid South. Its traces are
everywhere. It is of old, and it is of to-day; as universal
and as full of meaning as life itself.</p>

<p class="indent">It will be observed that we have already noted
proofs of the independent existence of this rite of
blood-brotherhood, or blood-friendship, among the
three great primitive divisions of the race&mdash;the Semitic,
the Hamitic, and the Japhetic; and this in Asia,
Africa, Europe, America, and the Islands of the Sea;
again, among the five modern and more popular divisions
of the human family: Caucasian, Mongolian,
Ethiopian, Malay, and American. This fact in itself
would seem to point to a common origin of its various
manifestations, in the early Oriental home of the now
scattered peoples of the world. Many references to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
this rite, in the pages of classic literature, seem to
have the same indicative bearing, as to its nature and
primitive source.</p>


<h3><a name="lec1_6" id="lec1_6"></a>6. LIGHT FROM THE CLASSICS.</h3>

<p class="indent">Lucian, the bright Greek thinker, who was born and
trained in the East, writing in the middle of the second
century of our era, is explicit as to the nature and
method of this covenant as then practised in the East.
In his “Toxaris or Friendship,”<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Mnesippus the Greek,
and Toxaris the Scythian, are discussing friendship.
Toxaris declares: “It can easily be shown that Scythian
friends are much more faithful than Greek
friends; and that friendship is esteemed more highly
among us than among you.” Then Toxaris goes on
to say<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>: “But first I wish to tell you in what manner
we [in Scythia] make friends; not in our drinking
bouts as you do, nor simply because a man is of the
same age [as ourselves], or because he is our neighbor.
But, on the contrary, when we see a good man,
and one capable of great deeds, to him we all hasten,
and (as you do in the case of marrying, so we think it
right to do in the case of our friends) we court him,
and we [who would be friends] do all things together,
so that we may not offend against friendship, or seem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
worthy to be rejected. And whenever one decides to
be a friend, we [who would join in the covenant] make
the greatest of all oaths, to live with one another, and
to die, if need be, the one for the other. And this is
the manner of it: Thereupon, cutting our fingers, all
simultaneously, we let the blood drop into a vessel,
and having dipped the points of our swords into it,
both [of us] holding them together,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> we drink it.
There is nothing which can loose us from one another
after that.”</p>

<p class="indent">Yet a little earlier than Lucian, Tacitus, foremost
among Latin historians, gives record of this rite of
blood-brotherhood as practised in the East. He is telling,
in his Annals, of Rhadamistus, leader of the Iberians,
who pretends to seek a covenant with Mithradates,
King of the Armenians (yet farther east than Scythia),
which should make firm the peace between the two
nations, “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">diis testibus</i>,” “the gods being witnesses.”
Here Tacitus makes an explanation:<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> “It is the custom
of [Oriental] kings, as often as they come together to
make covenant, to join right hands, to tie the thumbs
together, and to tighten them with a knot. Then,
when the blood is [thus] pressed to the finger tips,
they draw blood by a light stroke, and lick<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> it in turn.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
This they regard as a divine<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> covenant, made sacred
as it were, by mutual blood [or blended lives].”</p>

<p class="indent">There are several references, by classical writers, to
this blood-friendship, or to this blood-covenanting, in
connection with Catiline’s conspiracy against the Roman
Republic. Sallust, the historian of that conspiracy,
says: “There were those at that time who said
that Catiline, at this conference [with his accomplices]
when he inducted them into the oath of partnership in
crime, carried round in goblets human blood, mixed
with wine; and that after all had tasted of it, with an
imprecatory oath, as is men’s wont in solemn rites [in
“<em>Sharb el ’Ahd</em>,”<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> as the Arabs would say] he opened
to them his plans.”<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Florus, a later Latin historian,
describing this conspiracy, says: “There was added
the pledge of the league,&mdash;human blood,&mdash;which
they drank as it was borne round to them in goblets.”<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
And yet later, Tertullian suggests that it was
their own blood, mingled with wine, of which the
fellow-conspirators drank together. “Concerning the
eating of blood and other such tragic dishes,” he
says, “you read (I do not know where), that blood
drawn from the arms, and tasted by one another,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
was the method of making covenant among certain
nations. I know not but that under Catiline such
blood was tasted.”<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p class="indent">In the Pitti Palace, in Florence, there is a famous
painting of the conspiracy of Catiline, by Salvator
Rosa; it is, indeed, Salvator Rosa’s masterpiece, in the
line of historical painting. This painting represents
the covenanting by blood. Two conspirators stand
face to face, their right hands clasped above a votive
altar. The bared right arm of each is incised, a little
below the elbow. The blood is streaming from the
arm of one, into a cup which he holds, with his left
hand, to receive it; while the dripping arm of the
other conspirator shows that his blood has already
flowed into the commingling cup.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The uplifted hand
of the daysman between the conspirators seems to indicate
the imprecatory vows which the two are assuming,
in the presence of the gods, and of the witnesses
who stand about the altar. This is a clear indication
of the traditional form of covenanting between Catiline
and his fellow conspirators.</p>

<p class="indent">As far back, even, as the fifth century before Christ,
we find an explicit description of this Oriental rite of
blood-covenanting, in the writings of “the Father of
History.” “Now the Scythians,” says Herodotus,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
“make covenants in the following manner, with whomsoever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
they make them. Having poured out wine into
a great earthen drinking-bowl, they mingle with it the
blood of those cutting covenant, striking the body [of
each person having a part in it] with a small knife, or
cutting it slightly with a sword. Thereafter, they dip
into the bowl, sword, arrows, axe, and javelin.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> But
while they are doing this, they utter many invokings
[of curse upon a breach of this covenant];<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and, afterwards,
not only those who make the covenant, but
those of their followers who are of the highest rank,
drink off [the wine mingled with blood].”</p>

<p class="indent">Again Herodotus says of this custom, in his day<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>:
“Now the Arabians reverence in a very high degree
pledges between man and man. They make these
pledges in the following way. When they wish to
make pledges to one another, a third man, standing in
the midst of the two, cuts with a sharp stone the inside
of the hands along the thumbs of the two making
the pledges. After that, plucking some woolen floss
from the garments of each of the two, he anoints with
the blood seven stones [as the “heap of witness”<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>]
which are set in the midst. While he is doing this he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
invokes Dionysus and Urania. When this rite is completed,
he that has made the pledges [to one from
without] introduces the [former] stranger to his
friends<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>&mdash;or the fellow citizen [to his fellows] if the
rite was performed with a fellow-citizen.”</p>

<p class="indent">Thus it is clear, that the rite of blood-brotherhood,
or of blood-friendship, which is to-day a revered form
of sacred covenanting in the unchangeable East, was
recognized as an established custom among Oriental
peoples twenty-three centuries ago. Its beginning
must certainly have been prior to that time; if not
indeed long prior.</p>

<p class="indent">An indication of the extreme antiquity of this rite
would seem to be shown in a term employed in its
designation by the Romans, early in our Christian era;
when both the meaning and the origin of the term
itself were already lost in the dim past. Festus,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> a
writer, of fifteen centuries or more ago, concerning
Latin antiquities, is reported<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> as saying, of this drink
of the covenant of blood: “A certain kind of drink,
of mingled wine and blood, was called <i>assiratum</i> by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the ancients; for the ancient Latins called blood,
<i>assir</i>.” Our modern lexicons give this isolated claim,
made by Festus, of the existence of any such word as
“assir” signifying “blood,” in “the ancient Latin language;”<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
and some of them try to show the possibilities
of its origin;<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> but no convincing proof of any such
word and meaning in the Latin can be found.</p>

<p class="indent">Turning, however, to the languages of the East,
where the binding vow of blood-friendship was pledged
in the drink of wine and blood, or of blood alone,
from time immemorial, we have no difficulty in finding
the meaning of “assir.” <i>Asar</i> (<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1512;</span>) is a common
Hebrew word, signifying “to bind together”&mdash;as in
a mutual covenant. <i>Issar</i> (<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">&#1488;&#1460;&#1505;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;</span>), again, is a vow of
self-renunciation. Thus we have <i>Asar issar ’al nephesh</i>
(<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1463;&#1512; &#1488;&#1460;&#1505;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512; &#1506;&#1463;&#1500; &#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</span>) “To bind a self-devoting vow upon
one’s life”<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>&mdash;upon one’s blood; “for the blood is
the life.”<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
In the Arabic, also, <i>asara</i> (<span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">اسر</span>) means
“to bind,” or “to tie”; while <i>asar</i> (<span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">اسر</span>) is “a covenant,”
or “a compact”; and <i>aswâr</i> (<span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">اسوار</span>) is “a
bracelet”; which in itself is “a band,” and may be “a
fetter.”<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> So,
again, in the Assyrian, <i>esiru</i> <span class="nobreak">(<img src="images/glyph1a_064.png" class="middle3" alt="inline illustration" />)</span> is
in its root form “to bind”; and as a substantive it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
is “a bracelet,” or “a fetter.”<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> The Syriac gives <i>esar</i>
<span class="nobreak">(<img src="images/glyph15a_065.png" class="middle2" alt="inline illustration" />)</span>, “a bond,” or “a belt.”<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> All these, with the
root idea, “to bind”&mdash;as a covenant binds. In the light
of these disclosures, it is easy to see how the “issar” or
the “assar,” when it was a covenant of blood, came to
be counted by the Latins the blood which was a covenant.</p>

<h3><a name="lec1_7" id="lec1_7"></a>7. THE BOND OF THE COVENANT.</h3>

<p class="indent">Just here it may be well to emphasize the fact, that,
from time immemorial, and the world over, the armlet,
the bracelet, and the ring, have been counted the symbols
of a boundless bond between giver and receiver;
the tokens of a mutual, unending covenant. Possibly,&mdash;probably,
as I think,&mdash;this is in consequence of the
primitive custom of binding, as an amulet, the enclosed
record&mdash;enclosed in the “house of the amulet”<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>&mdash;of
the covenant of blood on the arm of either participant
in that rite; possibly, again, it is an outgrowth of the
common root idea of a covenant and a bracelet, as a
binding agency.</p>

<p class="indent">Blood-covenanting and bracelet-binding seem&mdash;as
already shown&mdash;to be intertwined in the <em>languages</em> of
the Oriental progenitors of the race. There are, likewise,
indications of this intertwining in the <em>customs</em> of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
peoples, East and West. For example, in India, where
blood-shedding is peculiarly objectionable, the gift and
acceptance of a bracelet is an ancient covenant-tie,
seemingly akin to blood-brotherhood. Of this custom,
an Indian authority says: “Amongst the rajput
races of India the women adopt a brother by the
gift of a bracelet. The intrinsic value of such pledges
is never looked to, nor is it necessary that it should
be costly, though it varies with the means and rank
of the donor, and may be of flock silk and spangles,
or of gold chains and gems. The acceptance of
the pledge is by the ‘<i>katchli</i>’, or corset, of simple silk
or satin, or gold brocade and pearls. Colonel Tod
was the <i>Rakhi-bund Bhai</i> [the Bracelet-bound Brother]
of the three queens of Oodipur, Bundi, and Kotch;
as also of Chund-Bai, the maiden sister of the Rana,
and of many ladies of the chieftains of rank. Though
the bracelet may be sent by maidens, it is only on occasions
of urgent necessity and danger. The adopted
brother may hazard his life in his adopted sister’s cause,

whom he has received the gift, and to defend her
against all her enemies, whenever she shall demand
his assistance.” Thus, the Great Mogul, Hoomâyoon,
father of the yet more celebrated Akbar, was in his
early life bound, and afterwards loyally recognized his
binding, as “the sworn knight of one of the princesses
of Rajasthan, who, according to the custom of her
country, secured the sword of the prince in her service
by the gift of a bracelet.” When he had a throne of
his own to care for, this princess, Kurnivati, being besieged
at Cheetore, sent to Hoomâyoon, then prosecuting
a vigorous campaign in Bengal; and he, as in duty
bound, “instantly obeyed the summons”; and
although he was not in season to rescue her, he
“evinced his fidelity by avenging the fall of the city.”<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
It is noteworthy, just here, that the Oriental biographer
of the Mogul Akbar calls attention to the fact,
that while the Persians describe close friendship as
chiefly subsisting between men, “in Hindostan it is
celebrated between man and woman”;<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> as indeed, it

<p class="indent">In the Norseland, an oath of fidelity was taken on a
ring, or a bracelet, kept in the temple of the gods;
and the gift and acceptance of a bracelet, or a ring,

he cites two witnesses to testify to his oath on the ring,
and to his having appealed to the gods in his denial

<p class="indent">It would, indeed, seem, that from this root-idea of
the binding force of an endless covenant, symbolized
in the form, and in the primitive name, of the bracelet,
the armlet, the ring,&mdash;there has come down to us the
use of the wedding-ring, or the wedding-bracelet, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
of the signet-ring as the seal of the most sacred covenants.
The signet-ring appears in earliest history.
When Pharaoh would exalt Joseph over all the land
of Egypt, “Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand,
and put it upon Joseph’s hand.”<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Similarly with
Ahasuerus and Haman: “The king took his ring from
his hand, and gave it unto Haman;” and the irrevocable
decrees when written were “sealed with the king’s
ring.” When again Haman was deposed and Mordecai
was exalted, “the king took off his ring, which he
had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai.”<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
The re-instatement of the prodigal son, in the parable,
was by putting “a ring on his hand.”<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> And these
illustrations out of ancient Egypt, Persia, and Syria,
indicate a world-wide custom, so far. One’s signet-ring
stood for his very self, and represented, thus, his
blood, as his life.</p>

<p class="indent">The use of rings, or bracelets, or armlets, in the
covenant of betrothal, or of marriage, is from of old,
and it is of wide-spread acceptance.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> References to it
are cited from Pliny, Tertullian, Juvenal, Isidore; and
traces of it are found, earlier or later, among the peoples
of Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Islands of the
Sea. In Iceland, the covenanting-ring was large
enough for the palm of the hand to be passed through;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
so, in betrothal “the bridegroom passed four fingers
and his palm through one of these rings, and in this
manner he received the hand of the bride.” In Ireland,
long ago, “a usual gift from a woman to her betrothed
husband was a pair of bracelets made of her
own hair”; as if a portion of her very self&mdash;as in the
case of one’s blood&mdash;entered into the covenant rite.
Again in Ireland, as also among the old Romans, the
wedding-ring was in the form of two hands clasped
(called a “<i>fede</i>”) in token of union and fidelity.</p>

<p class="indent">Sometimes, in England, the wedding-ring was worn
upon the thumb, as extant portraits illustrate; and as
suggested in Butler’s Hudibras:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Others were for abolishing</div>
<div class="verse1">That tool of matrimony, a ring,</div>
<div class="verse1">With which the unsanctify’d bridegroom</div>
<div class="verse1">Is marry’d only to a thumb.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">In Southern’s “Maid’s Last Prayer,” the heroine
says: “Marry him I must, and wear my wedding-ring
upon my thumb too, that I’m resolved.”<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> These
thumb-weddings were said to be introduced from the
East<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>; and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chardin</span> reports a form of marriage in
Ceylon, by the binding together of the thumbs of the
contracting parties;<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> as, according to the classics, the
thumbs were bound together in the rite of blood-covenanting.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
Indeed, the selection of the ring-finger for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the wedding-covenant has commonly been attributed
to the relation of that finger to the heart as the blood-centre,
and as the seat of life. “Aulus Gellius tells us,
that Appianus asserts, in his Egyptian books, that a
very delicate nerve runs from the fourth finger of the
left hand to the heart, on which account this finger is
used for the marriage-ring.” Macrobius says that in
Roman espousals the woman put the covenant ring “on
the third finger of her left hand [not counting the thumb],
because it was believed that a nerve ran from that finger
to the heart.” And as to the significance of this point,
it has been said: “The <em>fact</em> [of the nerve connection with
the heart] has nothing to do with the question: that the
ancients <em>believed</em> it, is all we require to know.”<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Among the Copts of Egypt, both the blood and the
ring have their part in the covenant of marriage.
Two rings are employed, one for the bride and one for
the bridegroom. At the door of the bridegroom’s
house, as the bride approaches it, a lamb or a sheep
is slaughtered; and the bride must have a care to step
over the covenanting-blood as she enters the door,
to join the bridegroom. It is after this ceremony,
that the two contracting parties exchange the rings,
which are as the tokens of the covenant of blood.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
In Borneo, among the Tring Dayaks, the marriage ceremony
includes the smearing with a bloody sword, the
clasped hands of the bride and groom, in conjunction
with an invoking of the protecting spirits.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> In this case,
the wedding-ring would seem to be a bond of blood.</p>

<p class="indent">Again, in Little Russia, the bride gives to the bridegroom
a covenanting draught in “a cup of wine, in
which a ring has been put”;<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> as if in that case the wine
and the blood-bond of the covenant were commingled
in a true <i>assiratum</i>.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> That this latter custom is an
ancient one, would seem to be indicated by the indirect
reference to it in Sir Walter Scott’s ballad of “The
Noble Moringer,” a mediæval lay; where the long
absent knight returns from the Holy Land, just in
time to be at the wedding-feast of his enticed wife.
He appears unrecognized at the feast, as a poor
palmer. A cup of wine is sent to him by the bride.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“It was the noble Moringer that dropped amid the wine</div>

<div class="versea">’Twas with that very ring of gold he pledged his bridal truth.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Clearly this was not the ring he gave at his bridal,
but the one which he accepted, in the covenanting-cup,
from his bride. The cup was carried back from the
palmer to the bride, for her drinking.</p>

<p class="indent">To the present day, an important ceremony at the
coronation of a sovereign of Great Britain, is the
investiture of the sovereign <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per annulum</i>, or “by the
ring.” The ring is placed on the fourth finger of the
sovereign’s right hand, by the Archbishop of Canterbury;
and it is called “The Wedding Ring of England,”
as it symbolizes the covenant union of the
sovereign and his people. A similar practice prevails
at the coronation of European sovereigns generally.
It also runs back to the days of the early Roman
emperors, and of Alexander the Great.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p class="indent">That a ring, or a circlet, worn around a thumb, or a
finger, or an arm, in token of an endless covenant
between its giver and receiver, has been looked upon,
in all ages, as the symbol of an inter-union of the lives
thereby brought together, is unmistakable; whether
the covenanting life-blood be drawn for such inter-commingling,
directly from the member so encircled,
or not. The very covenant itself, or its binding force,
has been sometimes thought to depend on the circlet
representing it; as if the life which was pledged
passed into the token of its pledging. Thus Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Bacon says: “It is supposed [to be] a help to the
continuance of love, to wear a ring or bracelet of the
person beloved;”<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> and he suggests that “a trial
should be made by two persons, of the effect of compact
and agreement; that a ring should be put on for
each other’s sake, to try whether, if one should break
his promise the other would have any feeling of it in
his absence.” In other words, that the test should be
made, to see whether the inter-union of lives symbolized
by the covenant-token be a reality. On this idea
it is, that many persons are unwilling to remove the
wedding-ring from the finger, while the compact holds.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p class="indent">It is not improbable, indeed, that the armlets, or
bracelets, which were found on the arms of Oriental
kings, and of Oriental divinities as well, were intended
to indicate, or to symbolize, the personal inter-union
claimed to exist between those kings and divinities.
Thus an armlet, worn by Thotmes III., is preserved
in the museum at Leyden. It bears the cartouche of
the King, having on it his sacred name, with its reference
to his inter-union with his god. It was much the
same in Nineveh.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Lane says, that upon the seal ring
commonly worn by the modern Egyptian “is engraved
the wearer’s name,” and that this name “is usually accompanied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
by the words ‘His servant’ (signifying ‘the
servant, or worshiper of God’), and often by other
words expressive of the person’s trust in God.”<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p class="indent">As the token of the blood-covenant is sometimes
fastened about the <em>arm</em>, and sometimes about the <em>neck</em>;
so the encircling necklace, as well as the encircling
armlet, is sometimes counted the symbol of a covenant
of very life. This is peculiarly the case in India;
where the bracelet-brotherhood has been shown to be
an apparent equivalent of the blood-brotherhood.
Among the folk-lore stories of India, it is a common
thing to hear of a necklace which holds the soul of the
wearer. That necklace removed, the wearer dies.
That necklace restored, the wearer lives again. “Sodewa
Bai was born with a golden necklace about her
neck, concerning which also her parents consulted astrologers,
who said, ‘This is no common child; the
necklace of gold about her neck contains your daughter’s
soul; let it therefore be guarded with the utmost
care; for if it were taken off, and worn by another
person, she would die.’” On that necklace of life, the
story hangs. The necklace was stolen by a servant,
and Sodewa Bai died. Being placed in a canopied
tomb, she revived, night by night, when the servant
laid off the stolen necklace which contained the soul
of Sodewa Bai. The loss was at last discovered by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
her husband; the necklace was restored to her, and
she lived again.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> And this is but one story of many.</p>

<p class="indent">In the Brahman marriage ceremony the bridegroom
receives his bride by binding a covenanting necklace
about her neck. “A small ornament of gold, called
<i>tahly</i>, which is the sign of their being actually in the
state of marriage, ... is fastened by a short
string dyed yellow with <em>saffron</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> And a Sanskrit
word for “saffron” is also a word for “blood.”<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The importance of this symbolism of the token of
the blood-covenant, in its bearing on the root-idea of
an inter-union of natures by an inter-commingling of
blood, will be more clearly shown, by and by.</p>


<h3><a name="lec1_8" id="lec1_8"></a>8. THE RITE AND ITS TOKEN IN EGYPT.</h3>

<p class="indent">Going back, now, to the world’s most ancient
records, in the monuments of Egypt, we find evidence
of the existence of the covenant of blood, in those
early days. Even then, it seems to have been a custom
to covenant by tasting the blood from another’s arm;
and this inter-transference of blood was supposed to
carry an inter-commingling, or an inter-merging, of
natures. So far was this symbolic thought carried,
that the ancient Egyptians spoke of the departed
spirit, as having entered into the nature, and, indeed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
into the very being, of the gods, by the rite of tasting
blood from the divine arm.</p>

<p class="indent">“The Book of the Dead,” as it is commonly called,
or “The Book of the Going Forth into Day,”&mdash;(“The
path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth
more and more unto the perfect day,”<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>)&mdash;is a group,
or series, of ancient Egyptian writings, representing
the state and the needs and the progress of the soul
after death.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> A copy of this Funereal Ritual, as it is
sometimes called, “more or less complete, according
to the fortune of the deceased, was deposited in the
case of every mummy.”<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> “As the Book of the Dead
is the most ancient, so it is undoubtedly the most
important of the sacred books of the Egyptians;”<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> it
is, in fact, “according to Egyptian notions, essentially
an inspired work;”<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> hence its contents have an exceptional
dogmatic value. In this Book of the Dead,
there are several obvious references to the rite of blood-covenanting.
Some of these are in a chapter of the
Ritual which was found transcribed in a coffin of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Eleventh Dynasty; thus carrying it back to a period
prior to the days of Abraham.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p class="indent">“Give me your arm; I am made as ye,” says the
departed soul, speaking to the gods.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Then, in explanation
of this statement, the pre-historic gloss of the
Ritual goes on to say: “The blood is that which
proceeds from the member of the Sun, after he goes
along cutting himself;”<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> the covenant blood which
unites the soul and the god is drawn from the flesh of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Rā, when he has cut himself in the rite of that covenant.
By this covenant-cutting, the deceased becomes
one with the covenanting gods. Again, the departed
soul, speaking as Osiris,&mdash;or as the Osirian, which
every mummy represents,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>&mdash;says: “I am the soul in
his two halves.” Once more there follows the explanation:
“The soul in his two halves is the soul of the
Sun [of Rā], and the soul of Osiris [of the deceased].”
Here is substantially the proverb of friendship cited
by Aristotle, “One soul in two bodies,” at least two
thousand years before the days of the Greek philosopher.
How much earlier it was recognized, does not
yet appear.</p>

<p class="indent">Again, when the deceased comes to the gateway
of light, he speaks of himself as linked with the
great god Seb; as one “who loves his arm,”<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> and
who is, therefore, sure of admittance to him, within
the gates. By the covenant of the blood-giving arm,
“the Osiris opens the turning door; he has opened
the turning door.” Through oneness of blood, he has
come into oneness of life, with the gods; there is no
longer the barrier of a door between them. The
separating veil is rent.</p>

<p class="indent">An added indication that the covenant of blood-friendship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
furnished the ancient Egyptians with their
highest conception of a union with the divine nature
through an interflowing of the divine blood&mdash;as the
divine life&mdash;is found in the amulet of this covenant;
corresponding with the token of the covenant of blood-friendship,
which, as fastened to the arm, or about the
neck, is deemed so sacred and so precious, in the
primitive East to-day. The hieroglyphic word, <i>tat</i>,
<i>tet</i>, or <i>tot</i>, <span class="nobreak">(<img src="images/glyph2a_081.png" class="middle2" alt="inline illustration" />)</span> translated “arm,” is also
translated “bracelet,” or “armlet,” <span class="nobreak">(<img src="images/glyph3a_081.png" class="middle" alt="inline illustration" />)</span><a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> as if in suggestion
of the truth, already referred to,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> that the blood-furnishing
arm was represented by the token of the arm-encircling,
or of the neck-encircling, bond, in the
covenant of blood. Moreover, a “red talisman,” or
red amulet, stained with “the blood of Isis,” and
containing a record of the covenant, was placed at the
neck of the mummy as an assurance of safety to his
soul.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> “When this book [this amulet-record] has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
been made,” says the Ritual, “it causes Isis to protect
him [the Osirian], and Horus he rejoices to see him.”
“If this book [this covenant-token] is known,” says
Horus, “he [the deceased] is in the service of Osiris....
His name is like that of the gods.”</p>

<p class="indent">There are various other references to this rite, or
other indications of its existence, than those already
cited, in the Book of the Dead. “I have welcomed
Thoth (or the king) with blood; taking the gore from
the blessed of Seb,”<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> is one of these gleams. Again,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
there are incidental mentions of the tasting of blood,
by gods and by men;<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> and of the proffering, or the
uplifting, of the blood-filled arm, in covenant with the
gods.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p class="indent">On a recently deciphered stéle of the days of Rameses
IV., of the Twentieth Dynasty, about twelve centuries
before Christ, there is an apparent reference to
this blood-covenanting, and to its amulet record. The
inscription is a specimen of a funereal ritual, not unlike
some portions of the Book of the Dead. The deceased
is represented as saying, according to the translation
of <span lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">Piehl</span><a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>: “I am become familiar with Thoth, by his
writings, on the day when he spat upon his arm.” The
Egyptian word, <i>khenmes</i>, here translated “familiar,”
means “united with,” or “joined with.” The word
here rendered “writings,” is <i>hetepoo</i>; which, in the
singular, <i>hetep</i>, in the Book of Dead, stands for the
record of the covenant on the blood-stained amulet.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
The word <i>peqas</i> <span class="nobreak">(<img src="images/glyph11a_083.png" class="middle4" alt="inline illustration" />)</span> rendered “spat,” by
<span lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">Piehl</span>, is an obscure term, variously rendered “moistened,”
“washed,” “wiped,” “healed.”<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> It is clear
therefore that this passage may fairly be read: “I am
become united with Thoth, by the covenant-record, on
the day when he moistened, or healed his arm”; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
if the arm were healed, it had been cut, and so moistened.
Indeed it is quite probable that this word <i>peqas</i>
has a root connection with <i>peq</i>, <i>peqa</i>, <i>peqau</i>, “a gap,”
“an opening,” “to divide”; and even with <i>penqu</i>,
<span class="nobreak">(<img src="images/glyph12a_084.png" class="middle3" alt="inline illustration" />)</span> “to bleed.” Apparently, the unfamiliarity
of Egyptologists with this rite of blood-covenanting,
by the cutting of the arm, has hindered
the recognition of the full force of many of the terms
involved.</p>

<p class="indent"><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ebers</span>, in his “Uarda,” has incidentally given an
illustration of the custom of blood-covenanting in
ancient Egypt. It is when the surgeon Nebsecht has
saved the life of Uarda, and her soldier-father, Kaschta,
would show his gratitude, and would pledge his life-long
fidelity in return.</p>

<p class="indent">“‘If at any time thou dost want help, call me, and
I will protect thee against twenty enemies. Thou hast
saved my child&mdash;good! Life for life. I sign myself
thy blood-ally&mdash;there!’</p>

<p class="indent">“With these words he drew his poniard, out of his
girdle. He scratched his arm, and let a few drops of
his blood run down on a stone at the feet of Nebsecht.</p>

<p class="indent">“‘Look!’ he said. ‘There is my blood! Kaschta
has signed himself thine; and thou canst dispose of
my life as of thine own. What I have said, I have
said.’”<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="lec1_9" id="lec1_9"></a>9. OTHER GLEAMS OF THE RITE.</h3>

<p class="indent">In this last cited illustration, from Uarda, there
would, at first glance, seem to be the covenant proffered,
rather than the covenant entered into; the covenant
all on one side, instead of the mutual covenant.
But this is, if it were possible, only a more unselfish
and a more trustful mode than the other, of covenanting
by blood; of pledging the life, by pledging the
blood, to one who is already trusted absolutely. And
this mode of proffering the covenant of blood, or of
pledging one’s self in devotedness by the giving of
one’s blood, is still a custom in the East; as it has been
in both the East and the West, from time immemorial.</p>

<p class="indent">For example, in a series of illustrations of Oriental
manners, prepared under the direction of the French
ambassador to Turkey, at the beginning of the eighteenth
century, there appears a Turkish lover gashing
his arm in the presence of his lady-love, as a proof of
his loving attachment to her; and the accompanying
statement is made, that the relative flow of blood thus
devoted indicates the measure of affection&mdash;or of affectionate
devotedness.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p class="indent">A custom akin to this was found in Otaheite, when
the South Sea Islands were first visited by English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
missionaries. The measure of love, in time of joy or
in time of grief, was indicated by the measure of blood
drawn from the person of the loving one. Particularly
was this the case with the women; perhaps because
they, in Otaheite as elsewhere, are more loving in their
nature, and readier to give of their very life in love.</p>

<p class="indent">“When a woman takes a husband,” says a historian
of the first missionary work in Otaheite, “she immediately
provides herself with a shark’s tooth, which is
fixed, with the bread-fruit gum, on an instrument that
leaves about a quarter of an inch of the tooth bare,
for the purpose of wounding the head, like a lancet.
Some of these have two or three teeth, and struck forcibly
they bring blood in copious streams; <em>according
to the love they bear the party</em>, and the violence of their
grief, <em>the strokes are repeated on the head</em>; and this
has been known to bring on fever, and terminate in
madness. If any accident happen to the husband, [to]
his relations, or friends, or their child, the shark’s tooth
goes to work; and even if the child only fall down
and hurt itself, the blood and tears mingle together....
They have a very similar way of expressing
their joy as well as sorrow; for whether a relation dies,
or a dear friend returns from a journey, the shark’s
tooth instrument ... is again employed, and the
blood streams down.... When a person of
eminence dies ... the relatives and friends ...
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
repeat before it [the corpse] some of the tender
scenes which happened during their life time, and wiping
the blood which the shark’s teeth has drawn, deposit
the cloth on the tupapow as the proof of their
affection.”<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p class="indent">In illustration of this custom, the same writer says,
in the course of his narrative: “When we had got
within a short mile of the Isthmus, in passing a few
houses, an aged woman, mother to the young man who
carried my linen, met us, and to express her joy at
seeing her son, struck herself several times on the head
with a shark’s tooth, till the blood flowed plentifully
down her breast and shoulders, whilst the son beheld
it with entire insensibility [He saw in it only the common
proof of his mother’s devoted love].... The
son seeing that I was not pleased with what was done,
observed coolly, that it was the custom of Otaheite.”<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p class="indent">This custom is again referred to by Mr. Ellis, as observed
by him in the Georgian and the Society Islands,
a generation later than the authority above cited. He
speaks of the shark’s tooth blood-letter, as employed
by men, as well as by women; although more commonly
by the latter. He adds another illustration of
the truth, that it is <em>the blood itself</em>, and not any suffering
caused by its flowing, that is counted the proof of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
affection; by its representing the outpoured life, in
pledge of covenant fidelity.</p>

<p class="indent">Describing the scenes of blood-giving grief, over
the dead bodies of the mourned loved ones, he says:
“The females on these occasions sometimes put on a
kind of short apron, of a particular sort of cloth;
which they held up with one hand, while they cut
themselves with the other. In this apron they caught
the blood that flowed from these grief-inflicted wounds,
until it [the apron] was almost saturated. It was then
dried in the sun, and given to the nearest surviving
relatives, as a proof of the affection of the donor, and
was preserved by the bereaved family as a token of
the estimation in which the departed had been held.”<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
There is even more of vividness in this memorial, than
in that suggested by the Psalmist, when he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Put thou my tears into thy bottle.”<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">There would seem to be a suggestion of this same
idea in one of Grimm’s folk-lore fairy tales of the
North. A queen’s daughter is going away from her
home, attended by a single servant. Her loving
mother would fain watch and guard her in her absence.
Accordingly, “as soon as the hour of departure had
arrived, the mother took her daughter into a chamber,
and there, with a knife, she cut her [own] finger with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
it, so that it bled. Then, she held her napkin beneath,
and let three drops of blood fall into it; which she
gave to her daughter, saying: ‘Dear child, preserve
this well, and it will help you out of trouble.’”<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> That
blood represented the mother’s very life. It was accustomed
to speak out in words of counsel and warning
to the daughter. But by and by the napkin which
held it was lost, and then the power of the young
princess over her mother’s servant was gone, and the
poor princess was alone in the wide world, at the mercy
of strangers.</p>

<p class="indent">Acting on the symbolism of this covenanting with
another by the loving proffer of one’s blood, men have
reached out toward God, or toward the gods, in
desire for a covenant of union, and in expression of
fidelity of devotedness, by the giving of their blood
God-ward. This, also, has been in the East and in
the West, in ancient days and until to-day.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a gleam of this, in the Canaanitish
worship of Baal, in the contest between his priests and
the prophet Elijah, before King Ahab, at Mount Carmel.
First, those priests shed the blood of the substitute
bullock, at the altar of their god, and “called on
the name of Baal from morning even until noon,
saying, O Baal hear us! But there was no voice,
nor any that answered.” Then they grew more earnest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
in their supplications, and more demonstrative in their
proofs of devotedness. “They leaped [or, limped]
about the altar which was made.... And they
cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with
knives and lances, till the blood gushed out upon
them.”<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> Similar methods of showing love for God are
in vogue among the natives of Armenia, to-day.
Describing a scene of worship by religious devotees in
that region, Dr. Van Lennep says: “One of them cuts
his forehead with a sword, so that ‘the blood gushes
out.’ He wears a sheet in front, to protect his clothes,
and his face is covered with clots of blood.”<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Clearly,
in this case, as in many others elsewhere, it is not as a
means of self-torture, but as a proof of self-devotedness,
that the blood is poured out&mdash;the life is proffered&mdash;by
the devotee, toward God.</p>

<p class="indent">Among the primitive peoples of North and of South
America, it was the custom of priests and people, to
draw blood from their own bodies, from their tongues,
their ears, their noses, their limbs and members, when
they went into their temples to worship, and to anoint
with that blood the images of their gods.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> The thorns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of the maguey&mdash;a species of aloe&mdash;were, in many regions,
kept ready at places of sacrifice, for convenient
use in this covenant blood-letting.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> A careful student
of these early American customs has said of the obvious
purpose of this yielding of one’s blood in worship,
that it “might be regarded as an act of individual
devotion, a gift made to the gods by the worshiper
himself, out of his own very substance [of his very
life, as in the blood-covenant].... The priests in
particular owed it to their special character [in their
covenant relation to the divinities], to draw their blood
for the benefit of the gods [in renewed pledge to the
gods]; and nothing could be stranger than the refined
methods they adopted to accomplish this end. For
instance, they would pass strings or splinters through
their lips or ears, and so draw a little blood. But then
a fresh string, or a fresh splinter, must be added every
day, and so it might go on indefinitely; for the more
there were, the more meritorious was the act;”<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> precisely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
as is the standard of love-showing by blood-letting
among Turkish lovers and Otaheitan wives and
mothers, in modern times.</p>

<p class="indent">A similar giving of blood, in proof of devotedness,
and in outreaching for inter-communion with the gods
through blood, is reported in India, in recent times.
Bishop Caldwell, of Madras, referred to it, a generation
ago, in his description of the “Devil Dance”
among the Tinnevelly Shawars.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> The devotee, in this
dance, “cuts and lacerates himself till the blood flows,
lashes himself with a huge whip, presses a burning
torch to his breast, drinks the blood which flows from
his own wounds, or drains the blood of the sacrifice;
putting the throat of a decapitated goat to his mouth.”
Hereby he has given of his own blood to the gods, or
to the devils, and has drunk of the substitute blood
of the divinities&mdash;in the consecrated sacrifice; as if in
consummation of the blood-covenant with the supernal
powers. “Then as if he had acquired new life [through
inter-union with the object of his worship], he begins
to brandish his staff of bells, and to dance with a
quick but wild unsteady step. Suddenly the afflatus
descends; there is no mistaking that glare or those
frantic leaps. He snorts, he swears, he gyrates.
The demon has now taken bodily possession of him.
[The twain are one. The two natures are intermingled]....
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
The devil-dancer is now worshiped
as a present deity, and every bystander consults him
respecting his diseases, his wants, the welfare of his
absent relations, the offerings to be made for the
accomplishments of his wishes, and in short everything
for which superhuman knowledge is supposed to be
available.” In this instance, the <em>mutual</em> covenant is
represented; the devotee both giving and receiving
blood, as a means of union.</p>

<p class="indent">On this idea of giving one’s self to another, by giving
of one’s blood, it is, that the popular tradition was
based, that witches and sorcerers covenanted with Satan
by signing a compact in their own blood. And
again it was in recognition of the idea that two natures
were inter-united in such a covenant, that the compact
was sometimes said to be signed in Satan’s blood.</p>

<p class="indent">Among the many women charged with witchcraft in
England, by the famous Matthew Hopkins, the “witch-finder”
in the middle of the Seventeenth century, was
one, at Yarmouth, of whom it is reported, that her
first temptation came to her when she went home from
her place of employment, discouraged and exasperated
by her trials. “That night when she was in bed, she
heard a knock at the door, and going to her window,
she saw (it being moonlight) a tall black man there:
and asked what he would have? He told her that she
was discontented, because she could not get work; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
that he would put her into a way that she should
never want anything. On this she let him in, and
asked him what he had to say to her. He told her he
must first see her hand; and taking out something like
a penknife, he gave it a little scratch, so that a little
blood followed; a scar being still visible when she told
the story. Then he took some of the blood in a pen,
and pulling a book out of his pocket, bid her write
her name; and when she said she could not, he said
he would guide her hand. When this was done, he
bid her now ask what she would have.”<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> In signing
with her own blood, she had pledged her very life to
the “tall black man.”</p>

<p class="indent">Cotton Mather, in his “Wonders of the Invisible
World,” cites a Swedish trial for witchcraft, where the
possessed children, who were witnesses, said that the
witches, at the trysting-place where they were observed,
were compelled “to give themselves unto the devil,
and vow that they would serve him. Hereupon they
cut their fingers, and with blood writ their names in
his book.” In some cases “the mark of the cut finger
was [still] to be found.” Moreover the devil gave
meat and drink both to the witches and to the children
they brought with them. Again, Mather cites
the testimony of a witness who had been invited to
covenant with the Devil, by signing the Devil’s book.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
“Once, with the book, there was a pen offered him,
and an inkhorn with liquor in it that looked like
blood.”<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Another New England writer on witchcraft
says that “the witch as a slave binds herself by vow,
to believe in the Devil, and to give him either body or
soul, or both, under his handwriting, or some part of
<em>his</em> blood.”<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Even “within modern memory in Europe,” there
have been traces of the primitive rite of covenanting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
with God by the proffer of one’s blood. In the Russian
province of Esthonia, he who would observe this
rite, “had to draw drops of blood from his fore finger,”
and at the same time to pledge himself in solemn covenant
with God. “I name thee [I invoke thee] with
my blood, and [I] betroth thee [I entrust myself to
thee] with my blood,”&mdash;was the form of his covenanting.
Then he who had given of his blood in self-surrendering
devotedness, made his confident supplications
to God with whom he had thus covenanted; and
his prayer in behalf of all his possessions was: “Let

<p class="indent">Thus, in ancient Egypt, in ancient Canaan, in ancient
Mexico, in modern Turkey, in modern Russia,
in modern India, and in modern Otaheite; in Africa,
in Asia, in America, in Europe, and in Oceanica:
Blood-giving was life-giving. Life-giving was love-showing.
Love-showing was a heart-yearning after
union in love and in life and in blood and in very being.
That was the primitive thought in the primitive religions
of all the world.</p>

<h3 class="no-break"><a name="lec2_1" id="lec2_1"></a>1. SACREDNESS OF BLOOD AND OF THE HEART.</h3>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Apart</span> from, and yet linked with, the explicit proofs
of the rite of blood-covenanting throughout the primitive
world, there are many indications of the root-idea
of this form of covenanting; in the popular estimate
of blood, and of all the marvelous possibilities
through blood-transference. These indications, also,
are of old, and from everywhere.</p>

<p class="indent">To go back again to the earlier written history of
the world; it is evident that the ancient Egyptians
recognized blood as in a peculiar sense life itself; and
that they counted the heart,&mdash;as the blood-source and
the blood-centre,&mdash;the symbol and the substance of
life. In the Book of the Dead, the deceased speaks
of his heart,&mdash;or his blood-fountain,&mdash;as his life; and
as giving him the right to appear in the presence of
the gods: “My heart was my mother; my heart was
my mother; my heart was my being on earth; placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
within me; returned to me by the chief gods, placing
me before the gods”<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> [in the presence of the gods].
In the process of embalming, the heart was always
preserved with jealous care;<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> and sometimes it was
embalmed by itself in a sepulchral vase.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> It was the
heart&mdash;as the life, which is the blood&mdash;that seems to
have been put into the scales of the divine Judge for
the settling of the soul’s destiny;<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> according to all the
Egyptian pictures of the judgment. Throughout the
Book of the Dead, and in all the sacred teachings and
practices of the ancient Egyptians, with reference to
human life and human destiny, the heart is obviously
recognized as the analogon of blood, and blood as the
analogon of life. Moreover, the life, which is represented
by the blood and by the heart, appears to be
counted peculiarly the gift and the guarded treasure
of Deity, and as being in itself a resemblance to, if
not actually a part of, the divine nature.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Even of the lower animals, the heart and the heart’s
blood were counted sacred to the gods, and were not
to be eaten by the Egyptians; as if life belonged only
to the Giver of life, and, when passing out from a
lower organism, must return, or be returned, only to
its original Source.</p>

<p class="indent">When the soul stands before the forty-two judges,
in the Hall of the Two Truths, to give answer concerning
its sins, one of its protesting avowals, as
recorded in the Book of the Dead, is: “Oh Glowing
Feet, coming out of the darkness! I have not eaten
the heart;”<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> In my earthly life-course, I have not
committed the sacrilege of heart-eating. Yet, of the
sacrificial offering of “a red cow,” as prescribed in the
Book of the Dead, “of the blood squeezed from the
heart, one hundred drops,”<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> make a portion for the
gods. In one of the tombs of Memphis, there is
represented a scene of slaughtering animals. As the
heart of an animal is taken out, the butcher who holds
it says,&mdash;as shown by the accompanying hieroglyphics,&mdash;“Take
care of this heart;”<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> as if that were a portion
to be guarded sacredly. “Keep thy heart with
all diligence [or, as the margin has it, “above all thou
guardest”]; for out of it are the issues of life.”<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> It
may, indeed, have been from the lore of Egypt that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Solomon obtained this proverb of the ages, to pass it
onward to posterity with his stamp of inspiration.</p>

<p class="indent">It would even seem that the blood of animals was
not allowed to be eaten by the Egyptians; although
there has been a question at that point, among
Egyptologists. Wilkinson thinks that they <em>did</em> employ
it in cooking;<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> but this is only his inference
from a pictured representation of the blood being
caught in a vessel, when an animal is slaughtered for
the table. On the other hand, that same picture shows
the vessel of blood being borne away, afterwards, on
uplifted hands;<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> as it would have been if it were
designed for a sacred libation. Again, the other
picture, reported by Birch, as showing the butcher’s
care of the heart, represents the blood as “collected
in a jar with a long spout”; such as was used for
sacred libations.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> It is evident that blood was offered
to the gods of Egypt in libation, as was also wine.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
Indeed the common Egyptian word for blood <span class="nobreak">(<img src="images/glyph13a_102.png" class="middle4" alt="inline illustration" /></span>,
<i>senf</i>) is regularly followed by the determinative of
outpouring <span class="nobreak">(<img src="images/glyph14a_102.png" class="middle2" alt="inline illustration" />)</span>. The word <i>tesher</i>, “red,” is sometimes
used as a synonym for <i>senf</i>; in this case (and in
this only) the determinative of outpouring is added to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the hieroglyphics for <i>tesher</i>. Moreover, among the
forty-two judges, before whom the dead appears, he
who is “Eater of Blood” comes next in order before
the “Eater of Hearts”;<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> as if blood-eating, like
heart-eating, were a prerogative of the gods.</p>

<p class="indent">If proof were still wanting that, in ancient Egypt, it
was the heart which was deemed the epitome of life,
and that the <em>heart</em> had this pre-eminence because of its
being the fountain of <em>blood</em>&mdash;which is life&mdash;that proof
would be found in “The Tale of the Two Brothers”;
a story that was prepared in its present form by a
tutor of the Pharaoh of the exodus, while the latter
was yet heir presumptive to the throne. This story
has been the subject of special study by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De Rougé,
Chabas</span>, Maspero, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Brugsch</span>, Birch, Goodwin, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le
Page Renouf</span>. It is from the latter’s translation, that
I draw my facts for this reference.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Anpu and Bata were brothers. Bata’s experience
with the wife of Anpu was like that of Joseph in the
house of Potiphar. He was true, like Joseph. Like
Joseph, he was falsely accused, his life was sought,
and his innocence was vindicated. Then, for his
better protection, Bata took his <em>heart</em> out from his
body, and put that in a safe place, while he made his
home near it. To his brother he had said:</p>

<p class="indent">“I shall take my heart, and place it in the top of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the flower of the cedar, and when the cedar is cut
down it will fall to the ground. Thou shalt come to
seek it. If thou art seven years in search of it, let not
thy heart be depressed, and when thou hast found it
thou shalt place it in a cup of cold water. Oh, then I
shall live (once more).”</p>

<p class="indent">After a time the cedar, through the treachery of
Bata’s false wife, was cut down. As it fell, with the
heart of Bata, the latter dropped dead. For more
than three years Anpu sought his brother’s heart;
then he found it. “He brought a vessel of cold water,
dropped the heart into it, and sat down according to
his daily wont. But when the night was come, the
heart absorbed the water. Bata [whose body seems
to have been preserved&mdash;like a mummy&mdash;all this time]
trembled in all his limbs, and continued looking at his
elder brother, but his heart was faint. Then Anpu
took the vessel of cold water which his brother’s
heart was in. And when the latter [Bata] had drunk it
up, his heart rose in its place; and he became as he had
been before. Each embraced the other, and each one
of them held conversation with his companion.”</p>

<p class="indent">The revivified Bata was transformed into a sacred
bull, an Apis. That bull, by the treachery, again, of
Bata’s wife, was killed. “And as they were killing
him, and he was in the hands of his attendants, he
shook his neck, and two drops of blood fell upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
two door-posts of His Majesty [in whose keeping was
the sacred bull]; one was on the one side of the great
staircase of His Majesty, the other upon the other
side; and they grew up into two mighty persea trees,
each of which stood alone.” Thus the blood was
both life and life-giving, and the heart was as the
very soul of its possessor, in the estimation of the
ancient Egyptians.</p>

<p class="indent">In primitive America also, as in ancient Egypt, the
blood and the heart, were held pre-eminently sacred.
Among the Dakotas, in North America, the heart of
the deer and of other animals killed in hunting, was
offered to the spirits.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> In Central America and in South
America, it was the blood and the heart of the human
victims offered in sacrifice, which were counted the
peculiar portion of the gods.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> In description of a
human sacrifice among the Nahuas of Central America,<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
a Mexican historian says: “The high priest then
approached, and with a heavy knife of obsidian cut
open the miserable man’s breast. Then, with a dexterity
acquired by long practice, the sacrificer tore
forth the yet palpitating heart, which he first offered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
to the sun, and then threw at the feet of the idol.
Taking it up, he again offered it to the god, and afterwards
burned it; preserving the ashes with great care
and veneration. Sometimes the heart was placed in
the mouth [of the idol] with a golden spoon. It was
customary also to anoint the lips of the image, and
the cornices of the door with the victim’s blood.”<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Of the method among the Maya nations,<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> south of
the Gulf of Mexico, a Spanish historian<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> says: “The
bleeding and quivering heart was held up to the sun,
and then thrown into a bowl prepared for its reception.
An assistant priest sucked the blood from the gash in
the chest, through a hollow cane; the end of which
he elevated towards the sun, and then discharged its
contents into a plume-bordered cup held by the captor
of the prisoner just slain. This cup was carried
around to all the idols in the temples and chapels, before
whom another blood-filled tube was held up, as
if to give them a taste of the contents. This ceremony
performed, the cup was left at the palace.”</p>

<p class="indent">Yet another record stands: “The guardian of the
temple ... opened the left breast of the victim,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
tore out the heart, and handed it to the high priest,
who placed it in a small embroidered purse which he
carried. The four [assisting] priests received the blood
of the victim in four jicaras or bowls, made from the
shell of a certain fruit; and descending, one after the
other, to the court yard, [they] sprinkled the blood
with their right hand in the direction of the cardinal
points [of the compass]. If any blood remained over,
they returned it to the high priest, who placed it, with
the purse containing the heart, in the body of the victim,
through the wound that had been made; and the
body was interred in the temple.”<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Commenting on these customs in Central America,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Réville</span>&mdash;the representative comparative-religionist of
France&mdash;says: “Here you will recognize that idea, so
widely spread in the two Americas, and indeed almost
everywhere amongst uncivilized peoples [nor is it
limited to the uncivilized], that the heart is the epitome,
so to speak, of the individual&mdash;his soul in some
sense&mdash;so that to appropriate his heart is to appropriate
his whole being.”<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> What else than this gave rise
to the thought of preserving the <em>heart</em> of a hero, or
of a loved one, as a symbol of the living presence of
the dead? It was by his heart, that King Robert
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Bruce was to lead his army to the Holy Land; and
how many times, in history, have men bequeathed
their hearts to those dear to them, as the poet Shelley’s
heart was preserved by his friends, and by them
given to Mrs. Shelley.</p>

<p class="indent">In the Greek and Roman sacrifices, it was the blood
of the victim, which, as the life of the victim, was
poured out unto the gods, as unto the Author of
life.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Moreover, there is reason for supposing that the
<em>heart</em> was always given the chief place, as representing
the very life itself, in the examination and in the
<em>tasting</em> of the “entrails” (<i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σπλάγχνα</i>, <i>splangkhna</i>) in
connection with the sacrifices of those classic peoples.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
An indication of this truth is found in a
statement by Cicero, concerning the sacrifices at the
time of the inauguration of Cæsar: “When he
[Cæsar] was sacrificing on that day in which he first
sat in the golden chair, and made procession in the
purple garment, there was no <em>heart</em> among the entrails
of the sacrificial ox. (Do you think, therefore, that
any animal which has blood can exist without a heart?)
Yet he [Cæsar] was not terrified by the phenomenal
nature of the event, although Spurinna declared, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
it was to be feared that both mind [literally ‘counsel’]
and life were about to fail him [Cæsar]; for both of
these [mind and life] do issue from the heart.”<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Similarly it has been, and to the present day it is,
with primitive peoples everywhere. Blood libations
were made a prominent feature in the offerings in
ancient Phoenicia,<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> as in Egypt. In India, the Brahmans
have a saying, in illustration of the claim that
Vishnu and Siva are of one and the same nature:
“The heart of Vishnu is Sivâ, and the heart of Sivâ
is Vishnu; and those who think they differ, err.”<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
The Hindoo legends represent the victim’s heart as being
torn out and given to the one whom in life he has
wronged.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> In China, at the great Temple of Heaven,
in Peking, where the emperors of China are supposed
to have conducted worship without material change
in its main features for now nearly three thousand
years,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> the blood of the animal sacrifice is buried in
the earth<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> while the body of the sacrificial victim is

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The blood is the life; the heart as the fountain of
blood is the fountain of life; both blood and heart are
sacred to the Author of life. The possession, or the
gift, of the heart or of the blood, is the possession, or
the gift, of the very nature of its primal owner. That
has been the world’s thought in all the ages.</p>


<h3><a name="lec2_2" id="lec2_2"></a>2. VIVIFYING POWER OF BLOOD.</h3>

<p class="indent">The belief seems to have been universal, not only
that the blood is the life of the organism in which it
originally flows, but that in its transfer from one organism
to another the blood retains its life, and so
carries with it a vivifying power. There are traces of this
belief in the earliest legends of the Old World, and of
the New; in classic story; and in medical practices as
well, all the world over, from time immemorial until
the present day.</p>

<p class="indent">For example, in an inscription from the Egyptian
monuments, the original of which dates back to the
early days of Moses, there is a reference to a then ancient
legend of the rebellion of mankind against the
gods; of an edict of destruction against the human
race; and of a divine interposition for the rescue of
the doomed peoples.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> In that legend, a prominent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
part is given to human blood, mingled with the juice
of mandrakes<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>&mdash;instead of wine&mdash;prepared as a drink
of the gods, and afterwards poured out again to overflow
and to revivify all the earth. And the ancient
text which records this legend, affirms that it was in
conjunction with these events, that there was the beginning
of sacrifices in the world.</p>

<p class="indent">An early American legend has points of remarkable
correspondence with this one from ancient Egypt.
It relates, as does that, to a pre-historic destruction of
the race, and to its re-creation, or its re-vivifying, by
means of transferred blood. Every Mexican province
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
told this story in its own way, says a historian; but
the main features of it are alike in all its versions.</p>

<p class="indent">When there were no more men remaining on the
earth, some of the gods desired the re-creation of mankind;
and they asked help from the supreme deities
accordingly. They were then told, that if they were
to obtain the bones, or the ashes of the former race,
they could revivify those remains by their own blood.
Thereupon Xolotl, one of the gods, descended to the
place of the dead, and obtained a bone (whether a <em>rib</em>,
or not, does not appear). Upon that vestige of humanity,
the gods dropped blood drawn from their own
bodies; and the result was a new vivifying of mankind.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p class="indent">An ancient Chaldean legend, as recorded by Berosus,
ascribes a new creation of mankind to the mixture by
the gods of the dust of the earth with the blood that
flowed from the severed head of the god Belus. “On
this account it is that men are rational, and partake of
divine knowledge,” says Berosus.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> The blood of the
god gives them the life and the nature of a god. Yet,
again, the early Phœnician, and the early Greek, theogonies,
as recorded by Sanchoniathon<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> and by Hesiod,<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
ascribe the vivifying of mankind to the outpoured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
blood of the gods. It was from the blood of Ouranos,
or of Saturn, dripping into the sea and mingling with
its foam, that Venus was formed, to become the mother
of her heroic posterity. “The Orphics, which
have borrowed so largely from the East,” says <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lenormant</span>,<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
“said that the immaterial part of man, his
soul [his life], sprang from the blood of Dionysus
Zagreus, whom ... Titans had torn to pieces,
partly devouring his members.”</p>

<p class="indent">Homer explicitly recognizes this universal belief in
the power of blood to convey life, and to be a means
of revivifying the dead. When Circé sent Odysseus,</p>

<p>Then, came the prophecy, from the blood-revivified seer.</p>

<p class="indent">The wide-spread popular superstition of the vampire
and of the ghoul, seems to be an outgrowth of
this universal belief, that transfused blood is re-vivification.
The bloodless shades, leaving their graves at
night, seek renewed life, by drawing out the blood of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
those who sleep; taking of the life of the living, to
supply temporary life to the dead. This idea was
prevalent in ancient Babylon and Assyria.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> It has
shown itself in the Old World and in the New,<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> in all
the ages; and even within a little more than a century,
it has caused an epidemic of fear in Hungary, “resulting
in a general disinterment, and the burning or staking
of the suspected bodies.”<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p class="indent">An added force is given to all these illustrations of
the universal belief that transferred blood has a vivifying
power, by the conclusions of modern medical
science, concerning the possible benefits of blood-transfusion.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
On this point, one of the foremost living
authorities in this department of practice, Dr. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Roussel</span>,
of Geneva, says: “The great vitality of the blood of
a vigorous and healthy man has the power of improving
the quality of the patient’s blood, and can restore
activity to the centres of nervous force, and the organs
of digestion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span> <em>It would seem that health itself can be
transfused with the blood of a healthy man</em>”;<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> death
itself being purged out of the veins by inflowing life.
And in view of the possibilities of new life to a dying
one, through new blood from one full of life, this
writer insists, that “every adult and healthy man and
woman should be ready to offer an <em>arm</em>, as the natural
and mysteriously inexhaustible source of the wonder-working
elixir.”<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> Blood-giving can be life-giving.
The measure of one’s love may, indeed, in <em>such</em> a case,
be tested by the measure of his yielded blood.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p class="indent"><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Roussel</span> says, that blood transfusion was practised
by the Egyptians, the Hebrews, and the Syrians, in
ancient times;<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> and he cites the legend, that before
Naaman came to Elisha to be healed of his leprosy,<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>
his physicians, in their effort at his cure, took the blood
from his veins, and replaced it with other blood.
Whatever basis of truth there may be in this legend, it
clearly gained its currency through the prevailing conviction
that new blood is new life. There certainly is
ample evidence that baths of human blood were anciently
prescribed as a cure for the death-representing
leprosy; as if in recognition of this root idea of the
re-vivifying power of transferred blood.</p>

<p class="indent">Pliny, writing eighteen centuries ago, concerning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
leprosy, or elephantiasis, says<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>: “This was the peculiar
disease of Egypt; and when it fell upon princes, woe
to the people; for, in the bathing chambers, tubs were
prepared, with human blood, for the cure of it.” Nor
was this mode of life-seeking confined to the Egyptians.
It is said that the Emperor Constantine was restrained
from it, only in consequence of a vision from heaven.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p class="indent">In the early English romance of Amys and Amylion,
one of these knightly brothers-in-arms consents, with
his wife’s full approbation, to yield the lives of his two
infant children, in order to supply their blood for a
bath, for the curing of his brother friend’s leprosy.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> In
this instance, the leprosy is cured, and the children’s
lives are miraculously restored to them; as if in proof
of the divine approbation of the loving sacrifice.</p>

<p class="indent">It is shown, indeed, that this belief in the life-bringing
power of baths of blood, to the death-smitten
lepers, was continued into the Middle Ages; and that
it finally “received a check from an opinion gradually
gaining ground, that only the blood of those would
be efficacious, who offered themselves freely and voluntarily
for a beloved sufferer.”<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> There is something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
very suggestive in this thought of the truest potency
of transferred life through transferred blood! It is this
thought which finds expression and illustration in
Longfellow’s Golden Legend. In the castle of Vautsberg
on the Rhine, Prince Henry is sick with a strange
and hopeless malady. Lucifer appears to him in the
garb of a traveling physician, and tells him of the only
possible cure for his disease, as prescribed in a venerable
tome:</p>

<p>The proffered sacrifice is interfered with before its consummation;
but its purposed method shows the estimate
which was put, from of old, on voluntarily yielded
life for life.</p>

<p class="indent">There is said to be an Eastern legend somewhat
like the story of Amys and Amylion; with a touch
of the ancient Egyptian and Mexican legends already
cited. “The Arabian chronicler speaks of a king,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
who, having lost a faithful servant by his transformation
into stone, is told that he can call his friend back
to life, if he is willing to behead his two children, and
to sprinkle the ossified figure with their blood. He
makes up his mind to the sacrifice; but as he approaches
the children with his drawn sword, the will
is accepted by heaven for the deed, and he suddenly
sees the stone restored to animation.”<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> This story, in
substance, (only with the slaying and the resuscitating
of the children, as in the English romance,) appears in
Grimm’s folk-lore tales, under the title of “Faithful
John”;<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> but whether its origin was in the East or in
the North, or in both quarters, is not apparent. Its
reappearance East, North, and West, is all the more
noteworthy.</p>

<p class="indent">In the romances of King Arthur and his knights,
there is a story of a maiden daughter of King Pellinore,
a sister of Sir Percivale, who befriends the noble
Sir Galahad, and then accompanies him and his companions
on their way to the castle of Carteloise, and
beyond, in their search for the Holy Grail.</p>

<p class="indent">“And again they went on to another castle, from
which came a band of knights, who told them of the
custom of the place, that every maiden who passed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
must yield a dish full of her blood. ‘That shall she
not do,’ said Galahad, ‘while I live’; and fierce was
the struggle that followed; and the sword of Galahad,
which was the sword of King David, smote them down
on every side, until those who remained alive craved
peace, and bade Galahad and his fellows come into the
castle for the night; ‘and on the morn,’ they said, ‘we
dare say ye will be of one accord with us, when ye
know the reason for our custom?’ So awhile they
rested, and the knights told them that in the castle
there lay a lady sick to death, who might never gain
back her life, until she should be anointed with the
blood of a pure maiden who was a king’s daughter.
Then said Percivale’s sister, ‘I will yield it, and so shall
I get health to my soul, and there shall be no battle
on the morn.’ And even so was it done; but the blood
which she gave was so much that she might not live;
and as her strength passed away, she said to Percivale,
‘I die, brother, for the healing of this lady.’ ... Thus
was the lady of the castle healed; and the gentle maiden,
[Percivale’s sister,] ... died.”<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p class="indent">In the old Scandinavian legends, there are indications
of the traditional belief in the power of transferred
life through a bath of blood. Siegfried, or Sigurd,
a descendant of Odin, slew Fafner, a dragon-shaped
guardian of ill-gotten treasure. In the hot blood of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
that dragon, he bathed himself, and so took on, as it
were, an outer covering of new life, rendering himself
sword-proof, save at a single point where a leaf of the
linden-tree fell between his shoulders, and shielded the
flesh from the life-imparting blood.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> On this incident
it is, that the main tragedy in the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Nibelungen Lied</span>
pivots; where Siegfried’s wife, Kriemhild, tells the
treacherous Hagan of her husband’s one vulnerable
point:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Said she, My husband’s daring, and thereto stout of limb;</div>
<div class="verse1">Of old, when on the mountain he slew the dragon grim,</div>

<div class="verse1">In his charmed person, the deadly dint of steel.</div>
<div class="verse2">. . . . . . . . . . . . .</div>
<div class="verse">“As from the dragon’s death-wounds gushed out the crimson gore,</div>
<div class="verse1">With the smoking torrent, the warrior washed him o’er.</div>
<div class="verse1">A leaf then ’twixt his shoulders fell from the linden bough;</div>
<div class="verse1">There, only, steel can harm him; for that I tremble now.”<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></div>

<p class="indent">Even among the blood-reverencing Brahmans of
India, there are traces of this idea, that life is to be
guarded by the outpoured blood of others. In the
famous old work, “Kalila wa-Dimna,” there is the
story of a king, named Beladh, who had a vision in
the night, which so troubled him that he sought counsel
of the Brahmans. Their advice was, that he
should sacrifice his favorite wife, his best loved son,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
his nephew, and his dearest friend, in conjunction
with other valued offerings to the gods. “It will be
necessary for you, O King,” they said, “when you
have put to death the persons we have named to you,
to fill a cauldron with their blood, and sit upon it;
and when you get up from the cauldron, we, the
Brahmans, assembled from the four quarters of the
kingdom, will walk around you, and pronounce our
incantations over you, and we will spit upon you, and
wipe off from you the blood, and will wash you in
water and sweet-oil, and then you may return to the
palace, trusting in the protection of heaven against the
danger which threatens you.”<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Here, the king’s offering to the gods, was to be of
that which was dearest to him; and the bath of blood
was to prove to him a cover of life. King Beladh
wisely said, that if that were the price of his safety he
was ready to die. He would not prolong his life at
such a cost. But the story shows the primitive
estimate of the life-giving power of blood, among the
Hindoos.</p>

<p class="indent">In China, also, blood has its place as a life-giving
agency. A Chinese woman, on the Kit-ie River, tells
a missionary, of her occasional seasons of frenzy,
under the control of spirits, and of her ministry of
blood, at such seasons, for the cure of disease.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span> “Every
year when there is to be a pestilence, or when cholera
is to prevail, she goes into this frenzy, and cuts her
tongue with a knife, letting some drops of her blood
fall into a hogshead of water. This [homœopathically-treated]
water, the people drink as a specific against
contagion.” Its sacred blood is counted a shield of life.
“With the rest of the blood, she writes charms, which
the people paste [as words of life] upon their door-posts,
or wear upon their persons, as preventives of
evil.”<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Receiving new blood as a means of receiving new
life, seems to have been sought interchangeably, in
olden time, in various diseases, by blood lavations, by
blood drinking, and by blood transfusion. It is
recorded that, in 1483, King Louis XI., of France,
struggled for life by drinking the blood of young
children, as a means of his revivifying. “Every day
he grew worse,” it is said; “and the medicines profited
him nothing, though of a strange character; for he
vehemently hoped to recover by the human blood
which he took and swallowed from certain children.”<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
Again there is a disputed claim, that, in 1492, a Jewish
physician endeavored to save the life of Pope Innocent
VIII., by giving him in transfusion the blood of three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
young men successively. The Pope was not recovered,
but the three young men lost their lives in the
experiment.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Yet blood transfusion as a means of
new life to the dying was not always a failure, even in
former centuries; for the record stands, that “at
Frankfort, on the Oder, the surgeons Balthazar, Kaufman,
and Purmann, healed a leper, in 1683, by passing
the blood of a lamb into his veins.”<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Even to-day, in South Africa, “when the Zulu King
is sick, his immediate personal attendants, or <i>valets</i>,
are obliged to allow themselves to be wounded; that
a portion of their blood may be introduced into the
king’s circulation, and a portion of his into theirs.”<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>
In this plan, the idea seems to be, that health may
have power over disease, and that death may be
swallowed up in life, by equalizing the blood of the
one who is in danger, and of the many who are in
strength and safety. Moreover among the Kafirs
those who are still in health are sometimes “washed
in blood to protect them against wounds”;<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> as if an
outer covering of life could be put on, for the protection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
of their life within. Transfused human blood is
also said to be a common prescription of the medicine-men
of Tasmania, for the cure of disease.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p class="indent">And so it would appear, that, whatever may be its
basis in physiological science, the opinion has prevailed,
widely and always, that there is a vivifying
power in transferred blood; and that blood not only
represents but carries life.</p>


<h3><a name="lec2_3" id="lec2_3"></a>3. A NEW NATURE THROUGH NEW BLOOD.</h3>

<p class="indent">It was a primeval idea, of universal sway, that the
taking in of another’s blood was the acquiring of
another’s life, with all that was best in that other’s
nature. It was not merely that the taking away
of blood was the taking away of life; but that the
taking in of blood was the taking in of life, and of all
that that life represented. Here, again, the heart, as
the fountain of blood, and so, as the centre and source
of life, was preeminently the agency of transfer, in the
acquiring of a new nature.</p>

<p class="indent">Herodotus tells us of this idea in the far East, twenty-four
centuries ago. When a Scythian, he said, killed
his first man in open warfare, he drank in his blood,
as a means of absorbing his fairly acquired life; and
the heads of as many as he slew, the Scythian carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
in triumph to the king;<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> as the American Indian
bears away the scalps of his slain, to-day. Modern
historians, indeed, show us other resemblances than
this, between the aboriginal American and the ancient
Scythian.</p>

<p class="indent">The Jesuit founder of the Huron Mission to the
American Indians, “its truest hero, and its greatest
martyr,” was <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jean de Brébeuf</span>. After a heroic life
among a savage people, he was subjected to frightful
torture, and to the crudest death. His character had
won the admiration of those who felt that duty to their
gods demanded his martyrdom; and his bearing under
torture exalted him in their esteem, as heroic beyond
compare. “He came of a noble race,” says
Parkman,<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>&mdash;“the same [race], it is said, from which
sprang the English Earls of Arundel; but never had
the mailed barons of his line confronted a fate so appalling,
with so prodigious a constancy. To the last
he refused to flinch, and ‘his death was an astonishment
to his murderers.’” “We saw no part of his
body,” wrote an eye witness,<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> “from head to foot,
which was not burned [while he was yet living], even
to his eyes, in the sockets of which these wretches
had placed live coals.” Such manhood as he displayed
under these tortures, the Indians could appreciate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Such courage and constancy as his, they longed
to possess for themselves. When, therefore, they perceived
that the brave and faithful man of God was
finally sinking into death, they sprang toward him,
scalped him, “laid open his breast, and came in a
crowd to drink the blood of so valiant an enemy;
thinking to imbibe with it some portion of his courage.
A chief then tore out his heart, and devoured it.”</p>

<p class="indent">Not unlike this has been a common practice among
the American Indians, in the treatment of prisoners of
war. “If the victim had shown courage,” again says
Parkman, concerning the Hurons, “the heart was first
roasted, cut into small pieces, and given to the young
men and boys, who devoured it, to increase their own
courage.”<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> So, similarly, with the Iroquois.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> And
Burton says of the Dakotas:<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> “They are not cannibals,
except when a warrior, after slaying a foe, eats,
porcupine-like, the heart or liver, with the idea of increasing
his own courage.” <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schomburgk</span>, writing
concerning the natives of British Guiana, says: “In
order to increase their courage, and [so their] contempt
of death, the Caribs were wont to cut out the
heart of a slain enemy, dry it on the fire, powder it,
and mix the powder in their drink.”<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The native Australians find, it is said, an inducement
to bloodshed, in their belief&mdash;like that of the ancient
Scythians&mdash;that the life, or the spirit, of the first man
whom one slays, enters into the life of the slayer, and
remains as his helpful possession thereafter.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> The
Ashantee fetishmen, of West Africa, apparently acting
on a kindred thought, make a mixture of the hearts
of enemies, mingled with blood and consecrated herbs,
for the vivifying of the conquerors. “All who have
never before killed an enemy eat of the preparation;
it being believed that if they did not, their energy would
be secretly wasted by the haunting spirits of their deceased
foes.”<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> The underlying motive of the bloody
“head-hunting” in Borneo, is the Dayak belief, that the
spirits of those whose heads are taken are to be subject
to him, who does the decapitating. The heads are primarily
simply the proof&mdash;like the Indian’s scalps&mdash;that
their owner has so many lives absorbed in his own.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p class="indent">A keen observer of Fellâheen life in Palestine has
reported:<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> “There is an ugly expression used among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the fellâheen of South Palestine, in speaking of an
enemy slain in war&mdash;‘<i>Dhabbahhtho bisnâny</i>’ (‘I slew
him with my teeth’)<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>; and it is said that there have
been instances of killing in battle in this fashion by
biting at the throat. In the Nablous district (Samaria),
where the people are much more ferocious, the expression
is, ‘I have drunk his blood’; but that is understood
figuratively.”</p>

<p class="indent">An ancient Greek version of the story of Jason,
telling of that hero’s treatment of the body of Apsyrtos&mdash;whom
he had slain&mdash;says: “Thrice he tasted the
blood, thrice [he] spat it out between his teeth;” and a
modern collator informs us, that the scholiast here finds
“the description of an archaic custom, popular among
murderers.”<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> This certainly corresponds with the Semitic
phrases lingering among the Fellâheen of Palestine.</p>

<p class="indent">In the old German epic, the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Nibelungen Lied</span>, it is
told of the brave Burgundians, when they were fighting
desperately in the burning hall of the Huns, that
they were given new courage for the hopeless conflict,
by drinking the blood of their fallen comrades; which
“quenched their thirst, and made them fierce.”<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> With

<p class="indent">Is there not, indeed, a trace of the primitive custom&mdash;thus
recognized in all quarters of the globe&mdash;of
absorbing the life of a slain one by drinking in his
blood, in our common phrase, “blood-thirstiness,”
as descriptive of a life-seeker? That phrase certainly
gains added force and appropriateness, in the light of
this universal idea.</p>

<p class="indent">It is evident that the wide-spread popular belief in
nature-absorption through blood-appropriation, has
included the idea of a <em>tribal</em> absorption of new life in
<em>vicarious</em> blood. Alcedo, a Spanish-American writer,
has illustrated this in his description of the native
Araucanians of South America. When they have
triumphed in war, they select a representative prisoner
for official and vicarious execution. After due preparation,
they “give him a handful of small sticks and a
sharp stake, with which they oblige him to dig a hole
in the ground; and in this they order him to cast the
sticks one by one, repeating the names of the principal
warriors of his country, while at the same time the
surrounding soldiers load these abhorred names with
the bitterest execrations. He is then ordered to cover
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the hole, as if to bury therein the reputation and valor
of their enemies, whom he has named. After this
ceremony, the toqui, or one of his bravest companions
to whom he relinquishes the honor of the execution,
dashes out the brains of the prisoner with a club.
The <em>heart</em> is immediately taken out, and presented
palpitating to the general, who sucks a little of the
<em>blood</em>, and passes it to his officers, who repeat in succession
the same ceremony.”<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> And in this way the life
of the conquered tribe passes, symbolically, into the
tribal life of the conquerors.</p>

<p class="indent">Burckhardt was so surprised at a trace of this idea
in Nubia, that he could hardly credit the information
concerning it; “although several persons asserted it
to be a fact,” he says; “and he heard no one contradict
it.”<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> As he learned it: “Among the Hallenga,
who draw their origin from Abyssinia, a horrible custom
is said to attend the revenge of blood. When
the slayer has been seized by the relatives of the deceased,
a family feast is proclaimed, at which the murderer
is brought into the midst of them, bound upon
an angareyg; and while his throat is slowly cut with
a razor, the blood is caught in a bowl, and handed
round amongst the guests; every one of whom is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
bound to drink of it, at the moment the victim breathes
his last.” The forfeited life of the murderer here seems
to be surrendered to, and formally appropriated by,
the family, or clan, which he had, to the same extent,
depleted of character and life.</p>

<p class="indent">A practice not unlike this is reported of the Australians,
in their avenging the blood of a murdered person.
They devour their victims; who are selected
from the tribe of the murderer, although they may be
personally, innocent of the murder. The tribe depleted
by the murder, replaces its loss by blood&mdash;which
is life&mdash;from the tribe of the murderer. Indeed, “when
any one of a tribe [in New South Wales] dies a natural
death, it is usual to avenge [or to cancel] the loss
of the deceased by taking blood from one or other of
his friends.”<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> In this way, the very life and being of
those whose blood is taken, go to restore to the bereaved
ones the loss that death has brought to them.</p>

<p class="indent">Strange as this idea may seem to us, its root-thought,
as a fact, is still an open question in the realm of physiological
science. The claim is positive, in medical
works, that insanity has been cured by the transfusion
of a sane man’s blood;<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> that a normal mind has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
restored, through a normal life gained in new blood.
Moreover, the question, how far the nature, or the characteristics,
of an organism, are affected, in blood transfusion,
by the nature, or the characteristics, of the
donor of the transfused blood, is by no means a settled
one among scientists. Referring to a series of
questions in this line, propounded by Robert Boyle,
more than two centuries ago, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Roussel</span> has said, within
the past decade: “No one has been able to give any
positive answers to them, based upon well-conducted
operations”; and, “they still await solution in 1877,
as in 1667.”<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>


<h3><a name="lec2_4" id="lec2_4"></a>4. LIFE FROM ANY BLOOD, AND BY A TOUCH.</h3>

<p class="indent">Because blood is life, all blood, and any blood, has
been looked upon as a vehicle of transferred life. And
because blood is life, and the heart is a fountain of
blood, and so is a fountain of life,&mdash;a touch of blood,
or, again, the minutest portion of a vital and vivifying
heart, has been counted capable of transferring life,
with all that life includes and carries; just as the merest
cutting of a vine, or the tiniest seed of the mightiest
tree, will suffice as the germ of that vine or that tree,
in a new planting. The blood, or the heart, of the
lower animals, has been deemed the vehicle of life
and strength, in its transference; and a touch from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
either has been counted potent in re-vivifying and in
improving the receiving organism.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus, for example, Stanley, in the interior of Africa,
having received “a fine, fat ox as a peace-offering,”
from “the great magic doctor of Vinyata,” when making
a covenant of blood with him,<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> was requested to
return the heart of the ox to the donor; and he acceded
to this request. After this, Stanley’s party was
several times assailed by the Wanyaturu, from the
neighborhood of Vinyata. Thereupon his ally Mgongo
Tembo explained, says Stanley: “That we ought not
to have bestowed the <em>heart</em> of the presented ox upon
the magic doctor of Vinyata; as by the loss of that
diffuser of blood, the Wanyaturu believed we had left
our own bodies weakened, and would be an easy prey
to them.”<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Another modern traveler in Equatorial Africa finds
fresh bullock’s blood counted a means of manhood.
While the young Masâi man is passing his novitiate
into warrior life, he seeks new strength by taking in
new blood. Having employed medical means to rid
his system of the remains of all other diet, says
Thompson, the novice went to a lonely place with a
single attendant; they taking with them a living bullock.
There “they killed the bullock, either with a
blow from a rungu, or by stabbing it in the back of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the neck. They then opened a vein and drank the
blood fresh from the animal.” After this, the young
man gorged himself with the bullock’s flesh.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> And
whenever the Masâi warriors “go off on war-raids they
also contrive to eat a bullock [after this fashion], by
way of getting up their courage.”<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Again, it is said, that Arab women in North Africa
give their male children a piece of the lion’s heart to
eat, to make them courageous.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> And an English
traveler in South Africa<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> describing the death of a lion
shot by his party, says: “Scarcely was the breath out
of his body than the Caffres rushed up, and each took
a mouthful of the blood that was trickling from the
numerous wounds; as they believe that it is a specific
which imparts strength and courage to those who partake
of it.”</p>

<p class="indent">That the transference of life, with all that life carries,
can be made by the simplest blood-anointing, as
surely as by blood absorption, is strikingly illustrated
by a custom still observed among the Hill Tribes of
India. The Bheels, are a brave and warlike race of
mountaineers, of Hindostan. They claim to have been,
formerly, the rulers of all their region; but, whether
by defeat in war, or by voluntary concession, to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
yielded their power to other peoples&mdash;whom they now
authorize to rule in their old domain. “The extraordinary
custom, common to almost all the countries [of
India] that have been mentioned,” says Sir J. Malcolm,<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
“of the <i>tika</i>, or mark that is put upon the forehead of
the Rajput prince, or chief, when he succeeds to
power, being moistened with blood taken from the toe
or thumb of a Bhill, may be received as one among
many proofs of their having been formerly in possession
of the principalities, where this usage prevails.</p>

<p class="indent">... The right of giving the blood for this ceremony,
is claimed by particular families; and the belief,
that the individual, from whose veins it is supplied,
never lives beyond a twelvemonth, in no degree operates
to repress the zeal of the Bhills to perpetuate an
usage, which the Rajput princes are, without exception,
desirous should cease.” The Bheels claim that
the right to rule is vested in their race; but they transfer
that right to the Rajpoot by a transfer of blood&mdash;which
is a transfer of life and of nature. Thus the
Bheels continue to rule&mdash;in the person of those who
have been vivified by their blood.</p>

<p class="indent">So, again, among the ancient Caribs, of South
America, “‘as soon as a male child was brought into
the world, he was sprinkled with some drops of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
father’s blood’; the father ‘fondly believing, that the
same degree of courage which he had himself displayed,
was by these means transmitted to his son.’”<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>
Here it is evident, that the voluntary transfusion of
blood is deemed more potent to the strengthening of
personal character, than is the transmission of blood
by natural descent.</p>

<p class="indent">In South Africa, among the Amampondo, one of
the Kaffir tribes, it is customary for the chief, on his
accession to authority, “to be washed in the blood of
a near relative, generally a brother, who is put to
death on the occasion, and his skull used as a receptacle
for his blood.”<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> In order to give more life and
more character than the ordinary possession to the
newly elevated chieftain, the family blood is withdrawn
from the veins of one having less need of it, that it
may be absorbed by him who can use it more imposingly.</p>

<p class="indent">In the Yoruba country, in Central Africa, “when a
beast is sacrificed for a sick man, the blood is sprinkled
on the wall, and smeared on the patient’s forehead,
with the idea, it is said, of thus transferring to him the
[divinely] accepted victim’s life.” Life is life, and
whether that life be in the blood of one organism or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
of another, of man or of an inferior animal, its transference
carries with it all that life includes. That
seems to be the thought in Yoruba; and, as all life is
of supernatural origin and preservation, its transference
can be by a touch as easily as by any other method.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>


<h3><a name="lec2_5" id="lec2_5"></a>5. INSPIRATION THROUGH BLOOD.</h3>

<p class="indent">Because blood, as life, belongs to, and, in a peculiar
sense, represents, the Author of life, blood has been
counted a means of inspiration. The blood of the
gods, in myth and legend, and again the blood of
divinely accepted sacrifices, human and animal, in
ancient and modern religious rituals, has been relied
on as the agency whereby the Author of life speaks
in and through the possessor of that blood.</p>

<p class="indent">The inspiring power of blood, is a thought that runs
all through the early Norseland legends. Thus, Kvaser,
according to the Scandinavian mythology, was a being
created by the gods with preternatural intelligence.
Kvaser traversed the world, teaching men wisdom;
but he was treacherously murdered by the dwarfs
Fjalar and Gala. The dwarfs let Kvaser’s blood run
into two cups and a kettle. “The name of the kettle
is Odrœrer, and the names of the cups are Son and
Bodn. By mixing up his blood with honey, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
composed a drink of such surpassing excellence, that
whoever partakes of it acquires the gift of song.”<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
And that was the origin of poetry in the world; although
there have been a good many imitations of the
real article since that day.</p>

<p class="indent">So, again, in the Elder Edda, the hero Sigurd killed
Fafner, at the instigation of Fafner’s brother Regin.
Regin cut out the heart of his brother, and gave it to
Sigurd to roast, while he drank the blood of the murdered
one. Touching the bleeding heart with his
fingers, and then putting his fingers into his mouth,
Sigurd found that he was now able to understand the
voice of birds; and thenceforward he was a hero
inspired.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Afterwards he gave his bride, Gudrun,
“to eat of the remnant of Fafnir’s heart; so <em>she</em> grew
wise and great-hearted.”<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Down to the present time, there are those in the
far East, and in the far West, who seek inspiration by
blood-drinking. All along the North Pacific coast,
the shamanism of the native tribes shows itself in a
craving for blood as a means and as an accompaniment
of preternatural frenzy. The chief sorcerer, or
medicine-man, has his seasons of demoniacal possession,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
when he can communicate with the powers of
the air. At such times he is accustomed to spring
upon the members of his tribe, and bite out from their
necks or bodies the bleeding flesh, as a help to inspiration
and debauch. None would venture to resist
these blood-thirsty assaults; but the scars which result
are always borne with pride.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Another phase of this universal idea is reported by
a recent traveler in the Himalayan districts of India;
where, as he thinks, the forms of religion ante-date in
their origin those of Hindooism, or of Brahmanism,
and “have descended from very early ages.” When
a favor is sought from a local divinity, “it is the <i>chela</i>
[or primitive seer] who gasps out the commands of
the <i>deoty</i> [the ‘deity’], as he [the chela] shivers under
the divine afflatus, and [under] the vigorous application
of the <i>soongul</i>, or iron scourge.” But before the
chela can have “the divine afflatus” he must drink-in
living blood. Thus, this traveler witnessed an appeal
to the snake-god, Kailung Nag, for fine weather for
the sowing of the crops. The sacrificial sheep was
procured by the people; the ceremonies of wild worship,
including music, dancing, incense-burning, and
bodily flagellations, proceeded. “At length, all being
ready, the head of the victim was struck off with an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
axe. The body was then lifted up by several men,
and the chela, seizing upon it like a tiger, drank the
blood as it spurted from the neck. When all the
blood had been sucked from the carcass, it was thrown
down upon the ground, amid yells and shouts of ‘<em>Kailung
Maharaj ki jai!</em>’ [‘Victory to the great king
Kailung’]. The dancing was then renewed, and became
more violent, until after many contortions, the
chela [now blood-filled] gasped out that the deota accepted
the sacrifice, and that the season would be favorable.
This was received with renewed shouts, and
the chela sank down upon the ground in a state of
exhaustion.”<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p class="indent">In the folk-lore of Scotland, as representing the
primitive traditions of Western Europe, there are illustrations
of the idea that the blood of the gods was
communicated to earthly organisms. Thus, a scientific
antiquarian of Scotland records in this line: “There
was a popular saying that the robin”&mdash;the robin red-breast&mdash;“had
a drop of God’s blood in its veins, and
that therefore to kill or hurt it was a sin, and that
some evil would befall any one who did so; and, conversely,
any kindness done to poor robin would be
repaid in some fashion. Boys did not dare to harry a
robin’s nest.” On the other hand, the yellow-hammer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
and the swallow were said, each “to have a drop of
the Devil’s blood in its veins”; so the one of these
birds&mdash;the yellow-hammer&mdash;was “remorselessly harried”;
and the other&mdash;the swallow&mdash;“was feared, and

<p class="indent">Another indication of the belief, that human blood
has a vital connection with its divine source, and is
under the peculiar oversight of its divine Author, is
found in the wide-spread opinion that the blood of a
murdered man will bear witness against the murderer,
by flowing afresh at his touch; the living blood crying
out from the dead body, by divine consent, in testimony
of crime against the Author of life. Ancient
European literature teems with incidents in the line of
this “ordeal of touch.”</p>

<p class="indent">Thus it was, according to the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Nibelungen Lied</span>, that

<p class="indent">Under Christian II., of Denmark, the “Nero of the
North,” early in the sixteenth century, there was a
notable illustration of this confidence in the power of
blood to speak for itself. A number of gentlemen
being together in a tavern, one evening, they fell to
quarreling, and “one of them was stabbed with a
poniard. Now the murderer was unknown, by reason
of the number [present]; although the person
stabbed accused a pursuivant of the king’s who was
one of the company. The king, to find out the homicide,
caused them all to come together in the stove
[the tavern], and, standing round the corpse, he commanded
that they should, one after another, lay their
right hand on the slain gentleman’s naked breast,
swearing that they had not killed him. The gentlemen
did so, and no sign appeared against them. The
pursuivant only remained, who, condemned before in
his own conscience, went first of all and kissed the dead
man’s feet. But, as soon as he had laid his hand upon
his breast, the blood gushed forth in abundance, both out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of his wound and his nostrils; so that, urged by this
evident accusation, he confessed the murder, and was by
the king’s own sentence, immediately beheaded.”<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p class="indent">A striking example of the high repute in which this
ordeal of touch was formerly held, and of the underlying
idea on which its estimate was based, is reported
from the State Trials of Scotland. It was during the
trial of Philip Standsfield, in 1688, for the murder of
his father, Sir James. The testimony was explicit,
that when this son touched the body, the blood flowed
afresh, and the son started back in terror, crying out,
“Lord, have mercy upon me!” wiping off the blood,
from his hand, on his clothes. Sir George M’Kenzie,
acting for the State, at the inquest, said concerning
this testimony and its teachings: “But they, fully
persuaded that Sir James was murdered by his own
son, sent out [with him] some surgeons and friends,
who having raised the body, did see it bleed miraculously
upon his touching it. In which, God Almighty
himself was pleased to bear a share in the testimonies
which we produce: that Divine Power which makes
the blood circulate during life, has oft times, in all
nations, opened a passage to it after death upon such
occasions, but most in this case.”<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Henry C. Lea, in his erudite work on Superstition
and Force, has multiplied illustrations of the
ordeal of touch, or of “bier-right,” all along the
later centuries.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> He recalls that “Shakspeare introduces
it, in King Richard III., where Gloster interrupts
the funeral of Henry VI., and Lady Anne exclaims:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse1">Open their congealed mouths, and bleed afresh.’”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He refers to the fact that it was an old-time Jewish
custom to ask pardon of a corpse for any offences
committed against the living man, laying hold of the
great toe of the corpse while thus asking; and if the
asker had really inflicted any grievous injury on the
deceased, the body was supposed to signify that fact
by a copious hemorrhage from the nose.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> “This, it
will be observed,” he adds, “is almost identical with
the well-known story which relates that, when Richard
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cœur-de-Lion</span> hastened to the funeral of his father,
Henry II., and met the procession at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fontevraud</span>, the
blood poured from the nostrils of the dead king,
whose end he had hastened by his disobedience and
rebellion.” Mr. Lea shows that in some instances the
bones of a murdered man are said to have given out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
fresh blood when handled by a murderer as long as
twenty years, or even fifty, after the murder; and he
gives ample evidence that a belief in this power of
blood to speak for itself against the violator of God’s
law, still exists among the English-speaking people,
and that it has manifested itself as a means of justice-seeking,
in the United States, within a few years past.</p>


<h3><a name="lec2_6" id="lec2_6"></a>6. INTER-COMMUNION THROUGH BLOOD.</h3>

<p class="indent">Beyond the idea of inspiration through an interflow
of God-representing blood, there has been in primitive
man’s mind (however it came there) the thought of a
possible inter-communion with God through an inter-union
with God by blood. God is life. All life is
from God, and belongs to God. Blood is life. Blood,
therefore, as life, may be a means of man’s inter-union
with God. As the closest and most sacred of covenants
between man and man; as, indeed, an absolute
merging of two human natures into one,&mdash;is a possibility
through an inter-flowing of a common blood;
so the closest and most sacred of covenants between
man and God; so the inter-union of the human nature
with the divine,&mdash;has been looked upon as a possibility,
through the proffer and acceptance of a common
life in a common blood-flow.</p>

<p class="indent">Whatever has been man’s view of sin and its punishment,
and of his separation from God because of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
unforgiven sin (I speak now of man as he is found,
without the specific teachings of the Bible on this
subject), he has counted blood&mdash;his own blood, in actuality
or by substitute&mdash;a means of inter-union with
God, or with the gods. Blood is not death, but life.
The shedding of blood, Godward, is not the taking of
life, but the giving of life. The outflowing of blood
toward God is an act of gratitude or of affection, a
proof of loving confidence, a means of inter-union.
This seems to have been the universal primitive conception
of the race. And an evidence of man’s trust
in the accomplished fact of his inter-union with God,
or with the gods, by blood, has been the also universal
practice of man’s inter-communion with God, or
with the gods, by his sharing, in food-partaking, of the
body of the sacrificial offering, whose blood is the
means of the divine-human inter-union.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps the most ancient existing form of religious
worship, as also the simplest and most primitive form,
is to be found in China, in the state religion, represented
by the Emperor’s worship at the Temple of
Heaven, in Peking. And in that worship, the idea
of the worshiper’s inter-communion with God, through
the body and blood of the sacrificial offering, is disclosed,
even if not always recognized, by all the representative
Western authorities on the religions of China.</p>

<p class="indent">“The Chinese idea of a sacrifice to the supreme
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
spirit of Heaven and of Earth is that of a banquet.
There is no trace of any other idea,” says Dr. Edkins.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>
Dr. Legge,<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> citing this statement, expands its significance
by saying: “The notion of the whole service
[at the Temple of Heaven] might be that of a banquet;
but a sacrifice and a banquet are incompatible
ideas.”<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> He then shows that the Chinese character
<i>tsî</i>, signifying “sacrifice,” “covers a much wider space
of meaning than our term sacrifice [as he seems to
view our use of that term].” Morrison gives as one
of the meanings of <i>tsî</i>, “That which is the medium
between, or brings together, men and Gods”; and
Hsü Shan “says, that <i>tsî</i> is made up of two ideograms;&mdash;one
the primitive for spiritual beings, and the
other representing a right hand and a piece of flesh.”
Legge adds: “The most general idea symbolized by
it is&mdash;an offering whereby communication and communion
with spiritual beings [God, or the gods] is
effected.”<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Dr. S. Wells Williams says, that “no religious system
has been found among the Chinese which taught
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the doctrine of the atonement by the shedding of
blood”; and this he counts “an argument in favor of
their [the Chinese] antiquity”; adding that “the state
religion ... has maintained its main features
during the past three thousand years.”<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> Williams
here, evidently, refers to an expiatory atonement for
sin; and Legge has a similar view of the facts.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> The
idea of an approach to God through blood&mdash;blood as
a means of favor, even if not blood as a canceling of
guilt&mdash;is obvious, in the outpouring of blood by the
Emperor when he approaches God for his worship in
the Temple of Heaven. The symbolic sacrifice in
that worship, which precedes the communion, is of a
whole “burnt offering, of a bullock, entire and without
blemish”;<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> and the blood of that offering is reverently
poured out into the earth,<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> to be buried there,
according to the thought of man and the teachings of
God in all the ages. It is even claimed that as early
as 2697 B. C., it was the blood of the first-born which
must be poured out toward God&mdash;as a means of favor&mdash;in
the Emperor’s approach for communion with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
God; “a first-born male,” being offered up “as a
whole burnt sacrifice,” in this worship.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> Surely, in this
surrender of the first-born, there must have been some
idea of an affectionate offering, in the gift of that which
was dearest, even if there was no idea of substitution
by way of expiation; something in addition to the
simple idea of “a banquet”; something which was an
essential preliminary to the banquet.</p>

<p class="indent">Access to God being attained by the Emperor, the
Emperor enjoys communion with God in the Temple
of Heaven. It is after the outpouring of blood, and
the offering of the holocaust, that&mdash;in a lull of the
orchestral music, in the great annual sacrifice&mdash;“a single
voice is heard, on the upper terrace of the altar,
chanting the words, ‘Give the cup of blessing, and the
meat of blessing.’ In response, the officer in charge
of the cushion advances and kneels, spreading the
cushion. Other officers present the cup of blessing
and the meat of blessing [which have already been
presented Godward] to the Emperor, who partakes of
the wine and returns them. The Emperor then again
prostrates himself, and knocks his forehead three
times against the ground, and then nine times more,
to represent his thankful reception of the wine and
meat [in communion].”<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">The evidence is abundant, that the main idea of this
primitive and supreme service in the religions of China,
is the inter-communion of the Emperor with God.
And there is no lack of proof that in China, as elsewhere
all the world over, blood&mdash;as life&mdash;is the means
of covenanting in an indissoluble inter-union; of
which inter-union, inter-communion is a result and a
proof.</p>

<p class="indent">In China, as also in India,<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> when the sacrifice of human
beings was abolished, it was followed by the sacrifice
of the horse. And the horse-sacrifice is still
practised in some parts of the Chinese Empire, on important
occasions. A white horse is brought to the
brink of a stream, or a lake, and there sacrificed, by
decapitating it, “burying its head below low-water
mark, but <em>reserving its carcase for food</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> In a description
of this sacrifice, in honor of a certain goddess,
as witnessed by Archdeacon Gray,<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> it is said: “Its
<em>blood</em> was received in a large earthenware jar, and a
portion carried to the temple of the aforesaid goddess;
when all the villagers rushed tumultuously to secure
a sprinkling of blood on the charms which they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
already purchased. The rest of the blood was mingled
with sand,” and taken with various accessories,
in a boat. “This boat headed a long procession of
richly carved and gilded boats, in which were priests,
both Buddhist and Taouists, and village warriors discharging
matchlocks to terrify the water-devils; while
the men in the first boat sprinkle the waters, as they
advance, with blood-stained sand.”</p>

<p class="indent">So, again, it is the blood of a cock,&mdash;not the body
but the blood,&mdash;which is made the propitiatory offering
to the goddess known as “Loong-moo, or the Dragon’s
Mother,” on the river junks of China. The blood is
sprinkled on the deck, near a temporary altar, where
libations of wine have already been poured out by
master of this junk, who is the sacrificer. Afterwards,
bits of silver paper are “sprinkled with the blood, and
then fastened to the door-posts and lintels of the
cabin”;<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> as if in token of the blood-covenant between
those who are within those doors and the goddess
whose substitute blood is there affixed. And this
precedes the feast of inter-communion.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Nor are indications wanting, that the idea of inter-union
with the gods by blood was originally linked
with, if it were not primarily based upon, the rite of
blood-covenanting between two human friends. Thus,
Archdeacon Gray unconsciously discloses traces of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
this rite, in his description of the exorcising of demons
from the body of a child, by a Taouist priest, in Canton.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>
Certain preliminary ceremonies were concluded;
which were supposed to drive out the demons. “The
priest then proceeded to uncover his [own] arm, and
made an incision with a lancet in the fleshy part. The
blood which flowed from the wound, was allowed to
mingle with a small quantity of water in a cup. The
seal of the temple, the impression of which was the
name of the idol, was then dipped into the blood, and
stamped upon the wrists, neck, back and forehead<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> of
the poor heathen child.” By this means, that child was
symbolically sealed in covenant relations with the god
of that temple, by the substitute blood of that god’s
representative priest.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus, also, Dr. Legge, referring to old-time covenantings
in China, says:<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> “Many covenants were made
among the feudal princes,&mdash;made over the blood of a
victim, with which each covenanting party smeared the
corners of his mouth [which is one form of tasting];<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
while an appeal was addressed to the invisible powers
to inflict vengeance on all who should violate the conditions
agreed upon [the ordinary imprecatory prayers
in the rite of blood-covenanting].” A symbolic inter-union
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
of blood is a basis of inter-communion between
two human beings, as also between the human and
the divine beings even in China&mdash;where, perhaps, that
idea would be least likely to be looked for.</p>

<p class="indent">It is a common opinion, that in no part of the world
is there a more general prejudice against blood-shedding,
or the taking of animal life, than in India. And
it certainly is a fact, that the great religious systems,
of Brahmanism and of Booddhism, which have controlled
the moral sense of the peoples of India for a
score or two of centuries, have exerted themselves,
in the main, to the inculcation of these views as to the
sacredness of blood and of life&mdash;or of blood which is
life. Hence, we would naturally look, in India, only
for traces, or vestiges, of the primitive, world-wide
idea of inter-communion with God, or with the gods,
through a divine-human inter-union by blood. Nor
are such traces and vestiges lacking in the religious
customs of India.</p>

<p class="indent">In India, as in China, human sacrifices, especially
the sacrifice of the first-born son, were formerly made
freely, as a means of bringing the offerer into closer
relations with the gods, through the outpoured blood.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
It was the blood, as the life, which was believed to be
the common possession of gods, men, and beasts;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
hence the final substitution, in India, of beasts for
men, in the blood-covenanting with the gods. On
this point, the evidence seems clear.</p>

<p class="indent">The Vedas, or sacred books of the Brahmans, teach,
indeed, that the gods themselves were mere mortals,
until by repeated offerings of blood in sacrifice, to
the Supreme Being, they won immortality from him;
which is only another way of making the claim, put
forward by the immortalized-mortal, in the Book of
the Dead, of ancient Egypt, that the mortal became
one with the gods through an interflow of a common
life in the common blood of the two. Mortals gave
the blood of their first-born sons in sacrifice to the
Supreme Being. Then the Supreme Being gave the
blood of his first-born male in sacrifice. Thus, the
nature of the favored mortals and the nature of the
Supreme Being became one and the same. Dr. Monier
Williams cites freely from the Vedas in the direction
of this great truth; although he does not note its bearing
on the blood-covenant rite. Thus, in “the following
free translation of a passage of the Satapatha-brāhmana:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="versea">‘The gods lived constantly in dread of Death&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse1">The mighty Ender&mdash;so, with toilsome rites</div>
<div class="verse1">They worshiped, and repeated sacrifices,</div>
<div class="verse1">Till they became immortal.’”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“And again in the Taittirīya-brāhmana: ‘By means of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the sacrifice the gods obtained heaven.’” In the Tāndya-brāhmanas:
“The lord of creatures offered himself
a sacrifice for the gods.” “And again, in the
Satapatha-brāhmana: ‘He who, knowing this, sacrifices
with the <i>Purusha-medha</i>, or sacrifice of the primeval
male, becomes everything.’”<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p class="indent">That it was the <em>blood</em>, which was the chief element
in the covenanting-sacrifice, is evident from all the
facts in the case. Thus, in the Aitareya-brāhmana, it
is said: “The gods killed a man for their victim [of
sacrifice]. But from him thus killed, the part which
was fit for a sacrifice went out and entered a horse.
Thence, the horse became an animal fit for being sacrificed.
The gods then killed the horse, but the part
of it fit for being sacrificed went out of it and entered an
ox. The gods then killed the ox, but the part of it fit
for being sacrificed went out of it and entered a
sheep. Thence it entered a goat. The sacrificial part
remained for the longest time in the goat; thence it
[the goat] became preeminently fit for being sacrificed!”
Indian history shows that this has been the progress
of reform, from the days of human sacrifice downward.
“It is remarkable that in Vedic times, even a cow
... was sometimes killed; and goats, as is well
known, are still sacrificed to the goddess Kālī.”<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> Kalī,
also called Doorgā, is the blood-craving goddess. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
blood of one human victim, it is said, “gives her a
gleam of pleasure that endures a thousand years; and
the sacrifice of three men together, would prolong her
ecstacy for a thousand centuries.”<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Bishop Heber indicates the “sacrificial part” of the
goat as he saw it offered at a temple of Kālī in Umeer.
He was being shown by his guide through that city,
on his first visit there, and the guide proposed a look
at the temple. “He turned short, and led us some
little distance up the citadel, then through a dark, low
arch into a small court, where, to my surprise, the first
object which met my eyes was a pool of blood on the
pavement, by which a naked man stood with a bloody
sword in his hand.... The guide ... cautioned
me against treading in the blood, and told me
that a goat was sacrificed here every morning. In
fact a second glance showed me the headless body of
the poor animal lying before the steps of a small
shrine, apparently of Kali. The Brahman was officiating
and tinkling his bell.... The guide told
us, on our way back, that the tradition was, that, in
ancient times a man was sacrificed here every day;
that the custom had been laid aside till Jye Singh [the
builder of Umeer] had a frightful dream, in which the
destroying power appeared to him, and asked why
her image was suffered to be dry [It is <em>blood</em>, not <em>flesh</em>,

that moistens]. The Rajah, afraid to disobey, and reluctant
to fulfil the requisition to its ancient extent of
horror, took counsel and substituted a goat [in which
as well as in man there is blood&mdash;which is life&mdash;which
is the chief thing in a sacrifice Godward] for the
human victim; with which the</p>

<p class="indent">“I had always heard, and fully believed till I came
to India,” says Bishop Heber, “that it was a grievous
crime, in the opinion of the Brahmans, to eat the flesh
or shed the blood of any living creature whatever. I
have now myself seen Brahmans of the highest caste
cut off the heads of goats, as a sacrifice to Doorga;
and I know from the testimony of Brahmans, as well
as from other sources, that not only hecatombs of
animals are often offered in this manner, as a most
meritorious act (a Rajah, about twenty-five years back
[say about <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 1800], offered sixty thousand in one
fortnight); but that any persons, Brahmans not excepted,
eat readily [in inter-communion] of the flesh
which has been offered up to one of their divinities.”<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Clearly, the idea of inter-communion with the gods,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
on the basis of the inter-flow of blood, exists in many
Brahmanic practices of to-day. It still finds its expression
in the occasional “Sacrifice of the Yajna, at
which a ram is immolated.” It is claimed by the
Brahmans that “this sacrifice is the most exalted and
the most meritorious of all that human beings can devise.
It is the most grateful to the gods. It calls
down all sorts of temporal blessings, and blots out all
the sins that can have been accumulated for four generations.”
The ram chosen for this sacrifice must be
“entirely white, and without blemish: of about three
years old.” Only Brahmans who are free from physical
infirmities and from ceremonial defects can have
a part in its offering, “at which no man of any other
caste can be present.” Because of the Brahmanic
horror of the shedding of blood, the victim is
smothered, or “strangled”; after which it is cut in
pieces, and burned as an oblation. “A part, however,
is preserved for him who presides at the sacrifice, and
part for him who is at the expense of it. These share
their portions with the Brahmans who are present;
amongst whom a scuffle ensues, each striving for a
small bit of the flesh. Such morsels as they can catch
they tear with their hands, and devour as a sacred
viand [the meat of inter-communion with the gods].
This practice is the more remarkable, as being the
only occasion in their [the Brahmans’] lives when they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
can venture to touch animal food.” “This most
renowned sacrifice ... is one of the six privileges
of the Brahmans”; and it would seem that its offering
may now be directed to any one of the divinities, at
the preference of the offerer. Formerly there was also
the “<em>Great</em> Sacrifice of the Yajna,” which is no longer
in use. “At this sacrifice,” in its day, “every species
of victim was immolated; and it is beyond doubt that
human beings even were offered up; but the horse and
the elephant were the most common.”<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> So, there has
never been an entire absence from the Brahmanic
practices of an inter-communion with the gods through
an inter-union by blood.</p>

<p class="indent">Even more remarkable than this canonical sacrifice
of the Yajna, with its accompanying inter-communion,
are some of the occult sacrifices to the gods of the
Hindoo Pantheon, in which all the ordinary barriers
of caste are disregarded, in the un-canonical but greatly
prized services of inter-communion with the gods on
the basis of an inter-flow of blood. The offerings of
blood-flowing sacrifices, including even the cow, are
made before the image of Vishnoo; or, more probably
of Krishna as one of the forms of Vishnoo. The spirituous
liquors of the country are also presented as drink-offerings.
Then follows the inter-communion. “He
who administers [at the offering to the god] tastes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
each species of meat and of liquor; after which he
gives permission to the worshipers to consume the
rest. Then may be seen men and women rushing
forward, tearing and devouring. One seizes a morsel,
and while he gnaws it, another snatches it out of his
hands, and thus it passes on from mouth to mouth till
it disappears, while fresh morsels, in succession, are
making the same disgusting round. The meat being
greedily eaten up, the strong liquors and the opium
[which have all been offered to the gods] are sent round.
All drink out of the same cup, one draining what
another leaves, in spite of their natural abhorrence
of such a practice.... All castes are confounded,
and the Brahman is not above the Pariah....
Brahmans, Sudras, Pariahs, men and women, swill the
arrack which was the offering to the Saktis, regardless
of the same glass being used by them all, which in
ordinary cases would excite abhorrence. Here it is a
virtuous act to participate in the same morsel, and to
receive from each other’s mouths the half-gnawn
flesh.”<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The fact that this service is of so disgusting a
character, does not lessen its importance as an illustration
of a primitive custom degraded by successive
generations of defiling influences. It still stands as
one of the proofs of the universal custom of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
attempted inter-communion with the gods through
an inter-union by blood. Indeed, there are many
traces, in India, of the survival of this primitive idea.
Referring to the worship of Krishna, under the form
of Jagan-natha (or Juggernaut, as the name is popularly
rendered) a recent writer on India says: “Before
this monstrous shrine, all distinctions of caste
are forgotten, and even a Christian may sit down and
eat with a Brahman. In his work on Orissa, Dr. W.
W. Hunter, says, that at the ‘Sacrament of the Holy
Food’ he has seen a Puri priest receive his food from a
Christian’s hand.... This rite is evidently also a
survival of Buddhism [It goes a long way back of
that]. It is remarkable that at the shrine of Vyankoba,
an obscure form of Siva, at Pandharpur, in the
Southern Maratha country, caste is also in abeyance,
all men being deemed equal in its presence. Food is
daily sent as a gift from the god to persons in all parts
of the surrounding country, and the proudest Brahman
gladly will accept and partake of it from the
hands of the Sudra, or Mahar, who is usually its
bearer. There are two great annual festivals in
honor of Jagan-natha.... They are held everywhere;
but at Puri they are attended by pilgrims from
every part of India, as many as 200,000 often being
present. All the ground is holy within twenty miles
of the pagoda, and the establishment of priests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
amounts to 3000. The ‘Sacrament of the Holy Food’
is celebrated three times a day.”<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Thus it is evident that the idea of inter-communion
with the gods has not been lost sight of in India, even
through the influence of Brahmanism and Booddhism
against the idea of divine-human inter-union by blood&mdash;which
is life. Indeed, this idea so pervades the religious
thought of the Hindoos, that the commands are
specific in their sacred books, that a portion of all food
must be offered to the spirits, before any of it is
partaken of by the eater. “It is emphatically declared
that he who partakes of food before it has been offered
in sacrifice as above described, eats but to his own
damnation;”<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> unless he discerns there the principle
of divine-human inter-communion, he eats to his own
spiritual destruction.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p class="indent">And just here it is well to notice an incidental item
of evidence that in India, as in the other lands of the
East, the sacrifices to the gods were in some way
linked with the primitive rite of human covenanting
by blood. An Oriental scholar has called attention to
the origin of the nose-ring, so commonly worn in India,
as described in the Hindoo Pāga-Vatham.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> The
story runs, that at the incarnation of Vishnoo as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Krishna, the holy child’s life was sought, and his
mother exchanged her infant for the child of another
woman, in order to his protection. In doing so, she
“bored a hole in the nose of her infant, and put a ring
into it as an impediment and a sign. The blood which
came from the wound was as a sacrifice to prevent him
from falling into the hand of his enemies.” And, to
this day, the nose-ring has two names, indicative of its
two-fold purpose. “The first [name] is <i>nate-kaddan</i>,
which signifies ‘the obligation or debt a person is under
by a vow’; the second [name] is <i>mooka-taddi</i>, literally
‘nose-impediment or hindrance,’ that is, to sickness
or death.” The child’s blood is given in covenant
obligation to the gods, and the nose-ring is the
token of the covenant-obligation, and a pledge of protected
life. When a Hindoo youth who has worn a
nose-ring would remove it, on the occasion of his marriage,
he must do so with formal ceremonies at the
temple, and by the use of a liquid “which represents
blood,” composed of saffron,<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> of lime, and of water. A
young tree must also be planted in connection with
this ceremony, as in the ceremony of blood-covenanting
in some portions of the East.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> These symbolisms
can hardly fail to be recognized as based on the universal
primitive rite of blood-covenanting.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The very earliest records of Babylon and Assyria,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
indicate the outreaching of man for an inter-union
with God, or with the gods, by substitute blood, and
the confident inter-communion of man with God, or
with the gods, on the strength of this inter-union by
blood. There is an Akkadian poem which clearly
“goes back to pre-Semitic times,” with its later Assyrian
translation, concerning the sacrifice to the gods,
of a first-born son.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> It says distinctly: “His offspring
for his life he gave.” Here is obviously the idea of
vicarious substitution, of life for life, of the blood of
the son for the blood of the father, but this substitution
does not necessarily involve the idea of an <em>expiatory</em>
offering for sin; even though it does include the
idea of <em>propitiation</em>. Abraham’s surrender of his
first-born son to God was in proof of his loving trust,
not of his sense of a penalty due for sin. Jephthah’s
surrender of his daughter was on a vow of devotedness,
not as an exhibit of remorse, or of penitence, for unexpiated
guilt. In each instance, the outpouring of substitute
blood was in evidence of a desire to be in new
covenant oneness with God. Thus Queen Manenko
and Dr. Livingstone made a covenant of blood vicariously,
by the substitution of her husband on the one
part, and of an attendant of Livingstone, on the other
part.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> So, also the Akkadian king may have sought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
a covenant union with his god&mdash;from whom sin had
separated him&mdash;by the substitute blood of his first-born
and best loved son.</p>

<p class="indent">Certain it is, that the early kings of Babylon and
Assyria were accustomed to make their grateful offerings
to the gods, and to share those offerings with the
gods, by way of inter-communion with the gods, apart
from any sense of sin and of its merited punishment
which they may have felt.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> Indeed, it is claimed, with
a show of reason, that the very word (<i>surqinu</i>) which
was used for “altar” in the Assyrian, was primarily
the word for “table”; that, in fact, what was later
known as the “altar” to the gods, was originally the
table of communion between the gods and their worshipers.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>
There seems to be a reference to this
idea in the interchanged use of the words “altar”
and “table” by the Prophet Malachi: “And ye say,
Wherein have ye despised thy name? Ye offer polluted
bread upon mine <em>altar</em>? And ye say, Wherein
have ye polluted thee? In that ye say, The <em>table</em>
of the Lord is contemptible.”<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> So again, in Isaiah
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
65 : 11: “But ye that forsake the Lord, that forget
my holy mountain, that prepare a <em>table</em> for Fortune,
and that fill up mingled wine unto Destiny; I will
destine you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down
to the slaughter.”</p>

<p class="indent">See, in this connection, the Assyrian inscription of
Esarhaddon, the son of Sennacherib,<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> in description of
his great palace at Nineveh: “I filled with beauties the
great palace of my empire, and I called it ‘The Palace
which Rivals the World.’ Ashur, Ishtar of Nineveh,
and the gods of Assyria, all of them, I feasted within
it. Victims precious and beautiful I sacrificed before
them, and I caused them to receive my gifts. I did
for those gods whatever they wished.”<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> It is even
claimed by Assyrian scholars, that in this inter-communion
with the gods, worshipers might partake of
the flesh of animals which was forbidden to them at
all other times<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>&mdash;as among the Brahmans of India,
to-day.</p>

<p class="indent">In farther illustration of the truth, that inter-communion
with the gods was shown in partaking of
sacred food with the gods, H. Fox Talbot, the Assyriologist,
says of the ancient Assyrian inscription:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
“There is a fine inscription, not yet fully translated,
describing the soul in heaven, clothed in a
white radiant garment, seated in the company of the
blessed, and fed by the gods themselves, with celestial
food.”<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Among the Parsees, or the Zoroastrians, who intervene,
as it were, between the primitive peoples of
Assyria and India, and the later inhabitants of the
Persian empire, there prevailed the same idea of divine-human
inter-union through blood, and of divine-human
inter-communion through sharing the flesh of the proffered
and accepted sacrifice, at the altar, or at the
table, of the gods, Ormuzd and Ahriman. The horse
was a favorite substitute victim of sacrifice, among the
Parsees; as also among the Hindoos and the Chinese.
Its blood was the means of divine-human inter-union.
“The flesh of the victim was eaten by the priest and
the worshipers; the ‘soul’ [the life, the blood], of it
only was enjoyed by Ormazd.”<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> The communion-drink,
in the Parsee sacrament, as still observed, is the
juice of the <i>haoma</i>, or <i>hom</i>. “Small bread [or wafers]
called Darun, of the size of a dollar, and covered with
a piece of meat, incense, and Haoma, or Hom,” the
juice of the plant known in India as Soma, are used in
this sacrament. “The Darun and the Hom [having
been presented to the gods] are afterwards eaten by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the priests,” as in communion.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> This is sometimes
called the “Sacrament of the Haoma.”<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p class="indent">In ancient Egypt, it seems to have been much as in
China, and India, and Assyria. Substitute blood was a
basis of inter-union between man and the gods; and a
divine-human inter-communion was secured as a proof
and as a result of that inter-union. That it was human
blood which was, of old in Egypt, poured out as a
means of this inter-union (in some cases at least) seems
clear. It is declared by Manetho, and Diodorus, and
Athenæus, and Plutarch, and Porphyry.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> It is recognized
as proven, by Kenrick<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> and <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ebers</span><a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> and other
Egyptian scholars. Wilkinson, it is true, was unwilling
to accept its reality, because, in his opinion, “it is
quite incompatible with the character of a nation
whose artists thought acts of clemency towards a foe
worthy of record, and whose laws were distinguished
by that humanity which punished with death the murder
even of a slave”;<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> and he prefers to rest on “the
improbability of such a custom among a civilized people.”
Yet, a single item of proof from the monuments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
would seem sufficient to settle this question, if it were
still deemed a question. The ideogram which was employed
on the seal of the priests, authorizing the
slaying of an animal in sacrifice, “bore the figure of a
man on his knees, with his hands tied behind him, and
a sword pointed at his throat.”<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Herodotus,<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> describing the magnificent festival of
Isis, at Busiris, says that a bull was sacrificed on that
occasion; and we know that in every such sacrifice
the blood of the victim was poured out as an oblation,
at the altar.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> When the duly prepared offering was
consumed upon the altar, those portions of the victim
which had been reserved were eaten by the priest and
others.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> Herodotus says, moreover, that some of the
Greeks who were present at this festival, were in the
habit of causing their own blood to flow during the
consuming of the sacrifice, as if in proof of their
desire for inter-union with the goddess, as precedent
to their inter-communion with her. He says: “But
as many of the Karians as are dwelling in Egypt, do
yet more than these [native Egyptians], inasmuch as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
they cut their foreheads with swords;<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> and so they
are shown to be foreigners and not Egyptians.”<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p class="indent">It would even seem that in Egypt, as in other parts
of the primitive world, the prohibition of the eating
of many sacred animals applied to the eating of them
when not offered in sacrifice. Because those animals
became, as it were, on the altar, or on the table, of the
gods, a portion of the gods themselves, they must not
be eaten except by those who discerned in them the
body of the gods, and who were entitled to share
them in inter-communion with the gods.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The monumental representations of the other world
show the gods sharing food and drink with the souls
of the deceased.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> And the idea of a divine-human
inter-communion through the partaking by gods and
men of the food provided for, or accepted by, the former,
runs all through the Egyptian record. A remarkable
illustration of this idea is found in an
extended inscription from the tomb of Setee I., whose
daughter is supposed to have been the finder of the
infant Moses. In this inscription, which is sometimes
called the Book of Hades, or more properly the Book
of Amenti, the Sun-god Rā is represented as passing
through Amenti&mdash;or the under world&mdash;on his nocturnal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
circuit, and speaking words of approval to his
disembodied worshipers there.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> “These are they who
worshiped Rā on the earth, ... who offered
their oblations.... They are [now] masters of
their refreshments; they take their meat; they seize
their offerings in the porch of him, whose being is
mysterious.... Rā says to them, Your offerings
are yours; take your refreshment.” Again and again
the declaration is made of “the elect,” of those who are
greeted by Rā in Amenti: “Their food is (composed)
of Rā’s bread; their drink [is] of his liquor <i>tesher</i> [a
common word for “red,” often standing for “blood”<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>]”.
And yet again: “Their food is to hear the word of
this god.”<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> “Their food is that of the veridical [the
truth-speaking] ones. Offerings are [now] made to

<p class="indent">Thus there was inter-communion between man and
the gods in ancient Egypt, on the basis of a blood-made
inter-union between man and the gods; as there
was also in primitive Assyria and Babylon, in primitive
India, and in primitive China.</p>

<p class="indent">Turning now from the far East to the far West, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
find that Central American and South American history
and legends tend to illustrate the same primitive
belief, that inter-communion with the gods was to be
secured by the hearty surrender of self&mdash;as evidenced
by the tender of personal, or of substitute <em>blood</em>. A
Guatemalan legend has its suggestion of that outreaching
of man for fire from heaven, which is illustrated
in the primitive and the classic myths of the
ages.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> The men of Guatemala were without the heaven-born
fire, and they turned, in their longing, to the
Quiché god, Tohil, seeking it from him, on such terms
as he might prescribe. “The condition finally named
by the god was, that they consent to ‘unite themselves
to me, under their armpit, and under their girdle, and
that they embrace me, Tohil’; a condition not very
clearly expressed [says a historian], but which, as
is shown by what follows, was an agreement to
worship the Quiché god, and sacrifice to him their
<em>blood</em>, and, if required, their <em>children</em>. They accepted
the condition, and received the fire.”<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p class="indent">In the light of the prevailing customs of the world,
concerning this rite of blood-covenanting, the requirements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
of the Quiché god were clearly based on the
symbolism of that rite; as the historian did not perceive,
from his unfamiliarity with the rite. If men
would be in favor with that god, and would receive his
choicest gifts, they must unite themselves to him;
must enter into oneness of nature with him, by giving
of their blood, from “under their armpit, and under
their girdle”; from the source of life, and at the issue
of life; for themselves and for their seed; and they
must lovingly embrace their covenant-god, accordingly.
And in the counsel given to those new
worshipers, it was said: “Make first your thanksgiving;
prepare the holes in your ears; [blood was drawn
from the ears, as well as from other parts of the body,
in Central American worship; indeed one of their
festivals was ‘the feast of piercing the ears,’ suggesting
a similar religious custom in India;<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>] pierce
your elbows; and offer sacrifice. This will be your
act of gratitude before God.”<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Among all these aboriginal races of Central America,
not only was the flesh of the sacrificial offerings
eaten as in communion with the gods; but the blood
of the offerings, and also the blood of the offerers
themselves, was sometimes sprinkled upon, or commingled
with, those articles of food, which were made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
a means of spiritual inter-communion with their deities.
Cakes of maize sprinkled with their own blood, drawn
from “under the girdle,” during their religious worship,
were “distributed and eaten as blessed bread.”<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
Moreover, an image of their god, made with certain
seeds from the first fruits of their temple gardens, with
a certain gum, and with the blood of human sacrifices,
was partaken of by them reverently, under the name,
“Food of our soul.”<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> At the conclusion of one of
the great feasts of the year at Cuzco, in Peru, the worshipers
“received the loaves of maize and the sacrificial
blood, which they ate as a symbol of brotherhood
with the Ynca”<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>&mdash;who claimed to be of divine blood
and of divine power.</p>

<p class="indent">Herrera describes one of these ceremonies of inter-communion
with the gods, by means of a blood-moistened
representation of a god. “An idol made of all
the varieties of the seeds and grain of the country,
was made, and moistened with the blood of children
and virgins. This idol was broken into small bits,
and given by way of communion to men and women
to eat; who, to prepare for that festival, bathed, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
dressed their heads, and scarce slept all the night.
They prayed, and as soon as it was day [they] were
all in the temple to receive that communion, with such
singular silence and devotion, that though there was
an infinite multitude, there seemed to be nobody. If
any of the idol was left, the priests ate it.”<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<p class="indent">So marked, indeed, was the sacramental character
of these Peruvian communion feasts, that a Spanish
Jesuit missionary to that country, three centuries ago,
was disposed to see in them an invention of Satan,
rather than a survival of a world-wide primitive custom.
He said: “That which is most admirable in the
hatred and presumption of Sathan is, that he not only
counterfeited in idolatry and sacrifices, but also in
certain ceremonies, our sacraments, which Jesus Christ
our Lord instituted, and the Holy Church uses; having,
especially, pretended to imitate, in some sort, the
sacrament of the communion, which is the most high
and divine of all others.”<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Yet again, a prisoner of war would be selected to
represent one of the gods, and so to be partaken of,
in inter-communion through his blood. He would
receive the name of the god; and for a longer or a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
shorter time,&mdash;“sometimes a year, sometimes six
months, and sometimes less,”&mdash;he would be ministered
to, and would receive honors and reverence as
a god. Then he would be offered in sacrifice. His
heart would be presented to the god. His blood
would be employed reverently&mdash;as was the case with
all sacrifices&mdash;in token of covenanting. His flesh
would be eaten by the worshipers of the god whom
he represented.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> This “rite of dressing and worshiping
the sacrifices like the deities themselves, is related
as being performed at the festivals of many gods and
goddesses.”<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p class="indent">A remarkable illustration of the unity of the race,
and of the universal sweep of these customs in conjunction
with the symbolism of the blood-covenant,
is found in the similarity of this last named Central
American practice, with a practice charged upon the
Jews by Apion, as replied to by Josephus. The charge
is, that “Antiochus found, upon entering the temple
[at Jerusalem], a man lying upon a bed, with a table
before him, set out with all the delicacies that either
sea or land could afford.” This captive’s story was:
“I am a Greek, and wandering up and down in quest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
of the means of subsistence, was taken up by some
foreigners, brought to this place, and shut up....
They gave me to understand, that the Jews had a custom
among them, once a year, upon a certain day prefixed,
to seize upon a Grecian stranger, and when they
had kept him fattening one whole year, to take him
into a wood, and offer him up for a sacrifice according
to their own form, <em>taking a taste of his blood</em>, with a
horrid oath to live and die sworn enemies to the
Greeks.”<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> Baseless as was this charge against the
Jews, its very framing indicates the existence in the
East,&mdash;possibly among the Phœnicians,&mdash;in days prior
to the Christian era, as well as in pre-historic times in
the West, of the custom of seeking inter-communion
with God, or with the gods, by the tasting of the blood
of a substitute human victim, offered in sacrifice to
God, or to the gods.</p>

<p class="indent">At the two extremes of the world, to-day, among
the primitive Bed´ween of the Desert of Arabia, and
among the primitive Indians of the prairies of North
America, there lingers a trace of this world-wide idea,
that the body of an offering covenanted to God by its
blood, can be a means of inter-communion with God
in its eating. Both the Bed´ween and the Indians connect
in their minds the fact of sacrificing and of feasting;
and they speak of the two things interchangeably.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">An Arab, when he makes a feast, speaks of sacrificing
the animal which is the main feature of that
feast. I saw an Arab wedding at Castle Nakhl, on
the Arabian Desert. The bridegroom sacrificed a
young dromedary in honor of the occasion, and to
furnish, as it were, the sacramental feast. The blood
of the victim was poured out unto the Lord, by being
buried in the earth&mdash;as the Chinese bury the blood of
their sacrifices in the Temple of Heaven. Portions
of the dromedary were eaten by all the guests, and a
portion was sent to the stranger encamping near them.
And that is the common method of Arab sacrificing
and feasting.</p>

<p class="indent">There is much of similarity in the ways of the Arabs
and of the Indians. The Indian feasts are largely
feasts of inter-communion with the gods. Whether it
were the human victim, of former times, whose blood
was drunk and whose heart was eaten, as preliminary
to the feasting on his entire remains;<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> or, whether it
be the preserved hearts and tongues of the buffaloes,
which now form the basis of some of the sacred feasts
of the Indians;<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>&mdash;the idea of divine-human inter-communion
was and is inseparable from the idea of
the feast. The first portion of the feast is always
proffered to the spirits, in order to make it, in a peculiar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
sense, a sacred feast. Then, each person having
a part in the feast is expected to eat the full share
assigned to him;<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> unless indeed he be permitted to
carry a remainder of it away “as sacred food” for the
benefit of the others.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p class="indent">And so the common root-idea shows itself, in lesser
or in larger degree, all the world over, and in all the
ages. It is practically universal.</p>

<p class="indent">One of the many proofs that the idea of a blood-covenanting
sacrifice is that of a loving inter-communion
between man and God, or the gods, is the fact
that the animals offered in sacrifice are always those
animals which are suitable for eating, whether their
eating is allowed at other times than when sacrificed,
or not. “Animals offered in sacrifice [at the Temple
of Heaven, in China],” says Dr. Edkins, “must be
those in use for human food. There is no trace in
China of any distinction between clean and unclean
animals, as furnishing a principle in selecting them for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
sacrifice. That which is good for food is good for
sacrifice, is the principle guiding in their selection.”<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>
The same <em>principle</em> has been already noted as prevailing
in the sacrifices of India, Assyria, and Egypt;
although in these last named countries many animals
which are “good for food” are not “in use for human
food” except as they are served up at the table of the
gods.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> In the primitive New World it was the same as
in the primitive Old World. Referring to the sacrifices
in ancient Peru, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Réville</span> says, “It should be noted that
they only sacrificed edible animals, which [as he would
understand it] is a clear proof that the intention was
to feed the gods”;<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> and it certainly seems a clear
proof that the intention was to feed the worshipers
who shared the sacred food.</p>

<p class="indent">That this sharing of the proffered and accepted sacrifice,
in divine-human inter-communion, was counted
a sharing of the divine nature, by the communicant,
seems evident, as widely as the world-wide custom
extended. The inter-union was wrought by intermingled
blood; the inter-communion gave a common
progress to the common nature. The blood gave common
life; the flesh gave common nourishment. “Almost
everywhere,” says <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Réville</span>,<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> “but especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
among the Aztecs, we find the notion, that the victim
devoted to a deity, and therefore destined to pass into
his substance, and to become by assimilation an
integral part of him, is already co-substantial with
him, has already become part of him; so that the
worshiper in his turn, by himself assimilating a part
of the victim’s flesh, unites himself in substance
with the divine being. And now observe [continues
this student in the science of comparative religion]
that in all religions the longing, whether grossly
or spiritually apprehended, to enter into the closest
possible union with the adored being, is fundamental.
This longing is inseparable from the religious sentiment
itself, and becomes imperious wherever that
sentiment is warm; and this consideration is enough
to convince us that it is in harmony with the most
exalted tendencies of our nature, but may likewise, in
times of ignorance, give rise to the most deplorable
aberrations.” This observation is the more noteworthy,
in that it is made by so pronounced a rationalist
as <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Réville</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">It would even seem to be indicated, by all the trend
of historic facts, that cannibalism&mdash;gross, repulsive,
inhuman cannibalism&mdash;had its basis in man’s perversion
of this outreaching of his nature (whether that
outreaching were first directed by revelation, or by
divinely given innate promptings) after inter-union and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
inter-communion with God; after life in God’s life, and
after growth through the partaking of God’s food, or
of that food which represents God. The studies of
many observers in widely different fields have led both
the rationalistic and the faith-filled student to conclude,
that in <em>their</em> sphere of observation it was a religious
sentiment, and not a mere animal craving,&mdash;either
through a scarcity of food, or from a spirit of malignity,&mdash;that
was at the bottom of cannibalistic practices
there; even if that field were an exception to the
world’s fields generally. And now we have a glimpse
of the nature and workings of that religious sentiment
which prompted cannibalism wherever it has been
practised.</p>

<p class="indent">Man longed for oneness of life with God. Oneness
of life could come only through oneness of blood.
To secure such oneness of life, man would give of his
own blood, or of that substitute blood which could
best represent himself. Counting himself in oneness
of life with God, through the covenant of blood, man
has sought for nourishment and growth through partaking
of that food which in a sense was life, and which
in a larger sense gave life, because it was the food of
God, and because it was the food which stood for God.
In misdirected pursuance of this thought, men have
given the blood of a consecrated human victim to
bring themselves into union with God; and then they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
have eaten of the flesh of that victim which had supplied
the blood which made them one with God. This
seems to be the basis of <em>fact</em> in the premises; whatever
may be the understood <em>philosophy</em> of the facts.
<em>Why</em> men reasoned thus, may indeed be in question.
<em>That</em> they reasoned thus, seems evident.</p>

<p class="indent">Certain it is, that where cannibalism has been studied
in modern times, it has commonly been found to
have had originally, a religious basis; and the inference
is a fair one, that it must have been the same
wherever cannibalism existed in earlier times. Even
in some regions where cannibalism has long since
been prohibited, there are traditions and traces of its
former existence as a purely religious rite. Thus, in
India, little images of flour paste or clay, are now
made for decapitation, or other mutilation, in the temples,<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>
in avowed imitation of human beings, who were
once offered and eaten there. Referring to the frequency
of human sacrifices in India, in earlier and in
later times, and to these emblematic substitutes for
them, now employed, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé Dubois</span> says:<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> “In
the kingdom of Tanjore there is a village called
Tirushankatam Kudi, where a solemn festival is celebrated
every year, at which great multitudes of people
assemble, each votary bringing with him one of those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
little images of dough, into the temple, dedicated to
Vishnu, and there cutting off the head in honor of
that god. This ceremony, which is annually performed
with great solemnity, was instituted in commemoration
of a famous event which happened in that
village.</p>

<p class="indent">“Two virtuous persons lived there, Sirutenden and
his wife Vanagata-ananga, whose faith and piety
Vishnu was desirous to prove. He appeared to them,
and demanded no other service of them but that of
sacrificing, with their own hands, their only and much
beloved son Siralen, and <em>serving up his flesh for a
repast</em>. The parents with heroic courage, surmounting
the sentiments and chidings of nature, obeyed without
hesitation, and submitted to the pleasure of the god.
So illustrious an act of devotion is held worthy of this
annual commemoration, at which the sacrifice is emblematically
renewed. The same barbarous custom is
preserved in many parts of India; and the ardor with
which the people engage in it leaves room to suspect
that they still regret the times when they would have
been at liberty to offer up to their sanguinary gods,
the reality, instead of the symbol.”</p>

<p class="indent">Such a legend as this, taken in conjunction with the
custom which perpetuates it, and with all the known
history of human sacrifices, in India and elsewhere,
furnishes evidence that cannibalism as a religious rite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
was known to the ancestors of the present dwellers in
India. And as it is in the far East, so it is in the far
West; and so, also, in mid-ocean.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus, for example, in the latter field, among the
degraded Feejee Islanders, where one would be least
likely to look for the sway of a religious sentiment
in the more barbarous customs of that barbarous
people, this truth has been recognized by Christian missionaries,
who would view the relics of heathenism with
no undue favor. The Rev. Messrs. Williams and Calvert,&mdash;the
one after thirteen years, and the other after
seventeen years of missionary service there,&mdash;said on
this subject: “Cannibalism is a part of the Fijian religion,
and the gods are described as delighting in
human flesh.” And again: “Human flesh is still the
most valued offering [to the gods], and their ‘drink
offerings of blood’ are still the most acceptable [offerings
to the gods] in some parts of Fiji.”<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p class="indent">It was the same among the several tribes of the North
American Indians, according to the most trustworthy
testimony. A Dutch clergyman, Dominie Megapolensis,
writing two centuries ago from near the present
site of Albany, “bears the strongest testimony to the
ferocity with which his friends, the Mohawks treated
their prisoners, ... and is very explicit as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
cannibalism. ‘The common people,’ he says ‘eat the
arms, buttocks, and trunk; but the chiefs eat the head
and the heart.’ This feast was of a religious character.”<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>
Parkman says, of the “hideous scene of feasting
[which] followed the torture of a prisoner,” “it
was, among the Hurons, partly an act of vengeance,
and partly a religious rite.”<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> He cites evidence, also,
that there was cannibalism among the Miamis, where
“the act had somewhat of a religious character [and],
was attended with ceremonial observances.”<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Of the religious basis of cannibalism among the
primitive peoples of Central and South America, students
seem agreed. Dorman who has carefully collated
important facts on this subject from varied sources,
and has considered them in their scientific bearings,
is explicit in his conclusions at this point. Reviewing
all the American field, he says: “I have dwelt longer
upon the painful subject of cannibalism than might
seem desirable, in order to show its religious character
and prevalence everywhere. Instead of being confined
to savage peoples, as is generally supposed, it prevailed
to a greater extent and with more horrible rites among
the most civilized. Its religious inception was the
cause of this.”<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> Again, he says, of the peoples of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Mexico and of the countries south of it: “All
the Nahua nations practised this religious cannibalism.
That cannibalism as a source of food, unconnected
with religious rites, was ever practised,
there is little evidence. Sahagun and Las Casas regard
the cannibalism of the Nahuas as an abhorrent
feature of their religion, and not as an unnatural appetite.”<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p class="indent"><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Réville</span>, treating of the native religions of Mexico
and Peru comes to a similar conclusion with Dorman;
and he argues that the state of things which was there
was the same the world over, so far as it related to
cannibalism. “Cannibalism,” he says,<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> “which is now
restricted to a few of the savage tribes who have remained
closest to the animal life, was once universal
to our race. For no one would ever have conceived
the idea of offering to the gods a kind of food which
excited nothing but disgust and horror.” In this suggestion,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Réville</span> indicates his conviction that the primal
idea of an altar was a table of blood-bought communion.
“Human sacrifices” however, he goes on to say, “prevailed
in many places when cannibalism had completely
disappeared from the habits and tastes of the population.
Thus the Semites of Western Asia, and the
Çivaïte Hindus, the Celts, and some of the populations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of Greece and Italy, long after they had renounced
cannibalism, still continued to sacrifice human beings
to their deities.” And he might have added, that some
savage peoples continued cannibalism when the religious
idea of its beginning had been almost swept away
entirely by the brutalism of its inhuman nature and
tendencies. Referring to the date of the conquest of
Mexico, he says: “Cannibalism, in ordinary life, was
no longer practised. The city of Mexico underwent
all the horrors of famine during the siege conducted
by Fernando Cortes. When the Spaniards finally entered
the city, they found the streets strewn with
corpses, which is a sufficient proof that human flesh
was not eaten even in dire extremities. And, nevertheless,
the Aztecs not only pushed human sacrifices
to a frantic extreme, but they were <em>ritual cannibals</em>,
that is to say, there were certain occasions on which
they ate the flesh of the human victims they had
immolated.”<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<p class="indent">And as it was in India and in America and in the
Islands of the Sea; so it seems to have been wherever
the primitive idea of cannibalism as a prevalent custom
has been intelligently sought out.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<h3><a name="lec2_7" id="lec2_7"></a>7. SYMBOLIC SUBSTITUTES FOR BLOOD.</h3>

<p class="indent">As the primitive and more natural method of commingling
bloods, in the blood-covenant, by sucking
each other’s veins, or by an inter-transference of
blood from the mutually opened veins, was in many
regions superseded by the symbolic laving, or sprinkling,
or anointing, with blood; and as the blood of the
lower animals was often substituted, vicariously, for
human blood;&mdash;so the blood and wine which were
commingled for mutual drinking in the covenant-rite,
or which were together poured out in libation, when
the covenant was between man and the Deity, came, it
would appear, to be represented, in many cases, by
the wine alone. First, we find men pledging each
other in a sacred covenant, in the inter-drinking of
each other’s blood mingled with wine. They called
their covenant-draught, “assiratum,” or “vinum assiratum”;
“wine, covenant-filled.” By and by, apparently,
they came to count simple wine&mdash;“the blood of
grapes”<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>&mdash;as the representative of blood and wine, in
many forms of covenanting.</p>

<p class="indent">This mutual drinking, as a covenant-pledge, has been
continued as an element in the marriage ceremony, the
world over, down to the present time. It would even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
seem that the gradual changes in the methods of this
symbolic rite could be tracked, through its various
forms in this ceremony, in different portions of the
world. Among the wide-spreading ’Anazeh Bed´ween,
the pouring out of a blood libation is still the mode
of completing the marriage-covenant. “When the
marriage day is fixed,” says Burckhardt,<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> “the bridegroom
comes with a lamb in his arms to the tent of
the father of his bride, and then, before witnesses, he
cuts its throat. As soon as the blood falls upon the
earth, the marriage ceremony is regarded as complete.”
Among the Bed´ween of Sinai, as Palmer tells
us,<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> the bride is sprinkled with the blood of the lamb,
before she is surrendered to the bridegroom. Lane’s
mention of the prominence of outpoured blood at the
weddings of the Copts in Cairo, has already been
cited.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> Among the Arabs, since the days of Muhammad,
wine has been generally abjured, and coffee now
commonly takes its place as a drink, in all ordinary
conferences for covenanting.</p>

<p class="indent">In Borneo, among the Dayaks, the bride and the
bridegroom sit side by side, facing the rising sun. Their
parents then besprinkle them with the blood of some
animal, and also with water. “Each being next presented
with a cup of arrack, they mutually pour half into each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
other's cup, take a draught, and exchange vessels.”<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>
In Burmah, among the Karens, water is poured upon
the bride as she enters the bridegroom’s house. When
she is received by the bridegroom, “each one then
gives the other to drink, and each says to the other,
‘Be faithful to thy covenant.’ This is the proper marriage
ceremony, and the parties are now married.”<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The blood of an ox, or a cow, is caused to flow at
the door of the bride’s house, as a part of the marriage
ceremony, in Namaqua Land.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> A similar custom
prevails among the Kafirs of Natal; and an observer
has said of this blood-flowing, in the covenanting
rite: “This appears to be the fixing point of the
ceremony”; this is “the real matrimonial tie.”<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Again it is the sharing from the same dish in drinking,
as well as in eating, that the bride and the bridegroom
covenant in marriage, in the Feejee Islands.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>
The liquor that is made the common draught, as a
substitute for the primitive blood-potion, is commonly
the spirituous drink of the region; whether that drink
be wine, or arrack, or whiskey, or beer. The symbolism
is the same in every case.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">In the Sanskrit, the word <i>asrij</i> signifies both “blood,”
and “saffron.”<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> In the Hindoo wedding ceremony,
in Malabar, “a dish of a liquid like blood, made of
saffron and lime,” is held over the heads of the bride
and groom. When the ceremony is concluded, the
newly married couple sprinkle the spectators with this
blood-like mixture;<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> which seems, indeed, not only
here but in many other cases, in India, to have become
a substitute for the covenanting blood. Reference
has already been made to its use in connection
with the covenant of the nose-ring; and the saffron
colored cord of the wedding necklace, among the Brahmans,
has also been mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p class="indent">A still more remarkable illustration of this saffron
mixture in lieu of blood, in formal covenanting, in
India, is found in its use in the rite of “adoption.”
In India, as elsewhere throughout the East, the desire
of every parent to have a son is very strong. A son
is longed for, to inherit the parental name and possessions,
to perform the funeral rites and the annual ceremonies
in honor of his parents; and, indeed, “it is
said in the Dattaka-Mimansa, ‘Heaven awaits not one
who is destitute of a son.’” When, therefore, parents
have not a son of their own, they often formally adopt
one; and, in this ceremony, saffron-water seems to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
take the place of blood, in the sacred and indissoluble
covenant of transfer.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> So prominent indeed is this
element of the saffron-water drinking&mdash;as the substitute
for blood-drinking&mdash;in the covenant of adoption,
that the adopted children of parents are commonly
spoken of as their “water-of-saffron children.” “Is
it good to adopt the child, and give it saffron-water?”
is a question that “occurs eight times in the book of
fate called Sagā-thevan-sāsteram.” Formal sacrifices
precede the ceremony of adoption, and mutual feasting
follows it. The natural mother of the child, in
his transfer to his new parents by adoption, hands
with him a dish of consecrated saffron-water; and
both the child and the blood-symbol are received by
the adopting father, with his declaration that the son is
now to enter into all that belongs to that father.
“Then he and his wife, pouring a little saffron water
into the hollow of their hands, and dropping a little
into that of the adoptive child, pronounce aloud before
the assembly: ‘We have acquired this child to
our stem, and we incorporate him into it.’ Upon
which they drink the saffron-water, and rising up,
make a profound obeisance to the assembly; to which
the officiating Brahmans reply by the word, ‘Asirvadam.’”<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">It seems to me in every way probable, that
in primitive times the blood of the child adopted, and
of the parents adopting him, was partaken of by the
three parties (as now throughout the East, in the case
of the blood-covenanting of friends), in order that the
child and his new parents might be literally of one
blood. But, with the prejudice which grew up against
blood-drinking, in India, the saffron-water came to be
used as a substitute for blood; even as the blood of
the grape came to be used instead of human blood, in
many other portions of the world.</p>

<p class="indent">In China, an important rite in the marriage ceremony
is the drinking of “the wedding wine,” from
“two singularly shaped goblets, sometimes connected
together by a red silk, or red cotton, cord, several
feet long.” After their worship of their ancestral
tablets, the bride and the bridegroom stand face to
face. “One of the female assistants takes the two
goblets ... from the table, and having partially
filled them with a mixture of wine and honey, she
pours some of their contents from one [goblet] into
the other, back and forth several times. She then
holds one to the mouth of the groom, and the other to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the mouth of the bride; who continue to face each
other, and who then sip a little of the wine. She
then changes the goblets, and the bride sips out of the
one just used by the groom, and the groom sips out
of the one just used by the bride, the goblets oftentimes
remaining tied together [by the red cord].
Sometimes she uses one goblet [interchanging its use
between the two parties] in giving the wine.”<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> The
Rev. Chester Holcombe, who has been a missionary
in China for a dozen years or more, writes me explicitly:
“I have been told that in ancient times blood was actually
used instead of the wine now used as a substitute,”
in this wedding-cup of covenanting.</p>

<p class="indent">Again, Professor Douglas says,<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> that for a thousand
years or so, it has been claimed that, at the birth of
each two persons who are to be married, the red cord
invisibly binds their feet together; which is only another
way of saying that their lives are divinely inter-linked,
as by the covenant of blood.</p>

<p class="indent">In Central America, among the Chibchas, it was a
primitive custom for the bridegroom to present himself
by night, after preliminary bargainings, at the
door of his intended father-in-law’s home, and there
let his presence be known. Then the bride would
come out to him, bringing a large gourd of <i>chica</i>, a
fermented drink made from the juice of Indian corn;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
“and coming close to him, she first tasted it herself,
and then gave it to him. He drank as much as he
could; and thus the marriage was concluded.”<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>
Among the Bheels of India, the drinking of the covenant
is between the representatives of the bridegroom,
and the parents of the bride, at the time of the betrothal;
but this is quite consistent with the fact that
the bride herself is not supposed to have a primary
part in the covenant.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> It is much the same also among
the Laplanders.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Among the Georgians and Circassians,<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> and also
among the Russians,<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> the officiating priest, at a marriage
ceremony, drinks from a glass of wine, and then
the bride and the groom drink three times, each, from
the same glass. The Galatians wedded, with a <dfn lang="la" xml:lang="la">poculum
conjugii</dfn>, “a wedding cup.”<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> In Greece, the marriage
ceremony concludes by the bride and the groom
“drinking wine out of one cup.”<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> In Switzerland,
formerly, the clergymen “took two glasses of wine,
mixed their contents, and gave one glass to the bride,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and the other to the bridegroom.”<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> Among European
Jews in olden time, the officiating rabbi, having blessed
a glass of wine, tasted it himself, and then gave it first
to the one and then to the other of the parties covenanting
in marriage.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p class="indent">This custom of covenanting in the wine-cup, at a
wedding, is said to have come into England from the
ancient Goths.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> Its symbolical significance and its
exceptional importance, seems to have been generally
recognized. Ben Jonson calls the wedding-wine a
“knitting cup”<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>&mdash;an inter-binding cup. And a later
poet asks, forcefully:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“What priest can join two lovers’ hands,</div>
<div class="verse1">But wine must seal the marriage bands?”<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In Ireland, as in Lapland and in India, it was at the
betrothal, instead of at the wedding, that the covenanting-cup&mdash;or
the “agreement bottle” as it was called&mdash;was
shared; and not unnaturally strong <dfn lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">usquebaugh</dfn>,
or “water of life,” was there substituted for wine&mdash;as
the representative of life-blood.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p class="indent">In Scotland, as in Arabia and in Borneo, the use of
blood in conjunction with the use of a wedding-cup
has continued down to recent times. The “agreement
bottle,” or “the bottling,” as it was sometimes
called, preceded the wedding ceremony proper. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the wedding, the blood of a cock was shed at the
covenanting feast. A reference to this is found in
“The Wowing [the Wooing or the Vowing?] of Jok
and Jynny,” among the most ancient remains of Scottish
minstrelsy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Jok tuk Jynny be the hand,</div>
<div class="verse3">And cryd ane feist, and slew ane cok,</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Among the ancient Romans, as also among the
Greeks, the outpouring of sacrificial blood, and the
mutual drinking of wine, were closely linked, in the
marriage ceremony. When the substitute victim was
ready for slaying, “the soothsayer drank wine out of
an earthen, or wooden, chalice, called in Latin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">simpulum</i>,
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">simpuvium</i>. It was in fashion much like our
ewers, when we pour water into the basin. This chalice
was afterward carried about to all the people, that
they also might <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">libare</i>, that is, lightly taste thereof;
which rite hath been called <em>libation</em>.” The remainder
of the wine from the chalice was poured on to the
victim, which was then slain; its blood being carefully
preserved. And these ceremonies preceded the marriage
feast.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> The wedding wine-drinking is now, however,
all that remains of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Indeed, it would seem that the common custom of
“drinking healths,” or of persons “pledging” each
other in a glass of wine, is but a degenerate modification,
or a latest vestige, of the primitive rite of covenanting
in a sacred friendship, by means of commingled
bloods shared in a wine-cup. Certainly this custom
prevailed among the old Norsemen, and among
the ancient Romans and Greeks. That it originally
included an idea of a possible covenant with Deity,
and of a spiritual fellowship, is indicated in the fact
that “the old Northmen drank the ‘minni’ [the loving
friendship] of Thor, Odin, and Freya; and of kings,
likewise, at their funerals.” So again there were
“such formulas as ‘God’s minnie!’ [and] ‘A bowl to
God in heaven!’”<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The earlier method of this ceremony of pledging
each other in wine, was by all the participants drinking,
in turn, out of a common bowl; as Catiline and
his fellow-conspirators drank their blood and wine in
mutual covenant; and as the Romans drank at a wedding
service. In the Norseland, to-day, this custom
is continued by the use of a drinking-bowl, marked by
pegs for the individual potation; each man as he receives
it, on its round, being expected to “drink his
peg.” And even among the English and the Americans,
as well as among the Germans, the touching of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
two glasses together, in this health-pledging, is a common
custom; as if in symbolism of a community in
the contents of the two cups. As often, then, as we
drink each other’s healths, or as we respond to any
call for a common toast-drinking, we do show a vestige
of the primeval and the ever sacred mutual covenanting
in blood.</p>


<h3><a name="lec2_8" id="lec2_8"></a>8. BLOOD-COVENANT INVOLVINGS.</h3>

<p class="indent">And now that we have before us this extended array
of related facts, concerning the sacred uses and the
popular estimates of blood, in all the ages, it will be
well for us to consider what we have learned, in the
line of blood-rights and of blood-customs, and in
the direction of their religious involvings. Especially
is it important for us to see, where and how all this
bears on the primitive and the still extant ceremony
of covenanting by blood, with which we started in this
investigation.</p>

<p class="indent">From the beginning, and everywhere, blood seems
to have been looked upon as preeminently the representative
of life; as, indeed, in a peculiar sense, life
itself. The transference of blood from one organism to
another, has been counted the transference of life, with
all that life includes. The inter-commingling of blood by
its inter-transference, has been understood as equivalent
to an inter-commingling of natures. Two natures thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
inter-commingled, by the inter-commingling of blood,
have been considered as forming, thenceforward, one
blood, one life, one nature, one soul&mdash;in two organisms.
The inter-commingling of natures, by the inter-commingling
of blood, has been deemed possible between
man and a lower organism; and between man and a
higher organism,&mdash;even between man and Deity, actually
or by symbol;&mdash;as well as between man and his
immediate fellow.</p>

<p class="indent">The mode of inter-transference of blood, with all
that this carries, has been deemed practicable, alike by
way of the lips, and by way of the opened and inter-flowing
veins. It has been also represented, by blood-bathing,
by blood-anointing, and by blood-sprinkling;
or, again, by the inter-drinking of wine&mdash;which was
formerly commingled with blood itself in the drinking.
And the yielding of one’s life by the yielding of
one’s blood has often been represented by the yielding
of the blood of a chosen and a suitable substitute.
Similarly the blood, or the nature, of divinities, has
been represented, vicariously, in divine covenanting,
by the blood of a devoted and an accepted substitute.
Inter-communion between the parties in a blood-covenant,
has been a recognized privilege, in conjunction
with any and every observance of the rite of blood-covenanting.
And the body of the divinely accepted
offering, the blood of which is a means of divine-human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
inter-union, has been counted a very part of the
divinity; and to partake of that body as food has been
deemed equivalent to being nourished by the very
divinity himself.</p>

<p class="indent">Blood, as life, has been looked upon as belonging,
in the highest sense, to the Author of all life. The
taking of life has been seen to be the prerogative of
its Author; and only he who is duly empowered, for
a season and for a reason, by that Author, for blood-taking
in any case, has been supposed to have the
right to the temporary exercise of that prerogative.
Even then, the blood, as the life, must be employed
under the immediate direction and oversight of its
Author. The heart of any living organism, as the blood-source
and the blood-fountain, has been recognized as
the representative of its owner’s highest personality;
and as the diffuser of the issues of his life and nature.</p>

<p class="indent">A covenant of blood, a covenant made by the inter-commingling
of blood, has been recognized as the
closest, the holiest, and the most indissoluble, compact
conceivable. Such a covenant clearly involves an absolute
surrender of one’s separate self, and an irrevocable
merging of one’s individual nature into the dual,
or the multiplied, personality included in the compact.
Man’s highest and noblest outreachings of soul have,
therefore, been for such a union with the divine nature,
as is typified in this human covenant of blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">How it came to pass, that men everywhere were so
generally agreed on the main symbols of their religious
yearnings and their religious hopes, in this realm of
their aspirations, is a question which obviously admits
of two possible answers. A common revelation from
God, may have been given to primitive man; and all
these varying yet related indications of religious strivings
and aim, may be but the perverted remains of the
lessons of that misused, or slighted, revelation. On
the other hand, God may originally have implanted
the germs of a common religious thought in the
mind of man, and then have adapted his successive
revelations to the outworking of those germs. Which
ever view of the probable origin of these common
symbolisms, all the world over, be adopted by any
Christian student, the importance of the symbolisms
themselves, in their relation to the truths of revelation,
is manifestly the same.</p>

<p class="indent">On this point, Kurtz has said, forcefully: “A comparison
of the religious symbols of the Old Testament
with those of ancient heathendom, shows that the
ground and the starting point of those forms of religion
which found their appropriate expressions in
symbols, was the same in all cases; while the history
of civilization proves that on this point, priority cannot
be claimed by the Israelites. But when instituting
such an inquiry, we shall also find that the symbols
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
which were transferred from the religions of nature to
that of the spirit, first passed through the fire of divine
purification, from which they issued as the distinctive
theology of the Jews; the dross of a pantheistic deification
of nature having been consumed.”<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> And as
to even the grosser errors, and the more pitiable perversions
of the right, in the use of these world-wide
religious symbolisms, Kurtz says, again: “Every error,
however dangerous, is based on some truth misunderstood,
and ... every aberration, however grievous,
has started from a desire after real good, which had
not attained its goal, because the latter was sought
neither in the right way, nor by right means.”<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> To
recognize these truths concerning the outside religions
of the world, gives us an added fitness for the comparison
of the symbolisms we have just been considering,
with the teachings of the sacred pages of revelation,
on the specific truths involved.</p>

<p class="indent">Proofs of the existence of this rite of blood-covenanting,
have been found among primitive peoples of all
quarters of the globe; and its antiquity is carried back
to a date long prior to the days of Abraham. All this,
outside of any indications of the rite in the text of
Bible itself. And now we are in a position to turn
intelligently to that text for fuller light on the subject.</p>

<h3 class="no-break"><a name="lec3_1" id="lec3_1"></a>1. LIMITATIONS OF INQUIRY.</h3>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">And</span> now, before entering upon an examination of
the Bible text, in the light of these disclosures of
primitive and universal customs, it may be well for me
to say, that I purpose no attempt to include or to explain
all the philosophy of sacrifice, and of the involved
atonement. All my thought is, to ascertain what new
meaning, if any, is found in the Bible teachings concerning
the uses and the symbolism of blood, through
our better understanding of the prevailing idea, among
the peoples of the ancient world, that blood represents
life; that the giving of blood represents the giving of
life; that the receiving of blood represents the receiving
of life; that the inter-commingling of blood represents
the inter-commingling of natures; and that
a divine-human inter-union through blood is the basis
of a divine-human inter-communion, in the sharing
of the flesh of the sacrificial offering as sacred food.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Whatever other Bible teachings there are, beyond
these, as to the meanings of sacrifice, or as to the
nature of the atonement, it is not my purpose, in this
investigation, to consider.</p>

<p class="indent">In the days of Moses, when the Pentateuch is supposed
to have been prepared, there were&mdash;as we have
already found&mdash;certain well-defined views, the world
over, concerning the sacredness of blood, and concerning
the methods, the involvings, and the symbolisms,
of the covenant of blood. This being so, we are not
to look to the Bible record, as it stands, for the original
institution of every rite and ceremony connected
with blood-shedding, blood-guarding, and blood-using;
but we may fairly look at every Bible reference to
blood, in the light of the primitive customs known to
have prevailed in the days of the Bible writing.</p>


<h3><a name="lec3_2" id="lec3_2"></a>2. PRIMITIVE TEACHINGS OF BLOOD.</h3>

<p class="indent">The earliest implied reference to blood in the Bible
text, is the record of Abel’s sacrifice. “And Abel was
a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
And in process of time it came to pass that Cain
brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto
the Lord. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings
of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had
respect unto Abel and to his offering: but unto Cain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
and to his offering he had not respect.”<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> An inspired
comment on this incident is: “By faith Abel offered
unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through
which he had witness borne to him that he was righteous,
God bearing witness in respect of [or, over] his
gifts: and through it he [Abel] being dead yet speaketh.”<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Now, on the face of it, in the light of all that we
know of primitive customs in this matter of the blood-covenant,
and apart from any added teachings in the
Bible concerning the nature and meanings of different
sacrifices, this narrative shows Abel, lovingly and
trustfully reaching out toward God with substitute
blood, in order to be in covenant oneness with God;
while Cain merely proffers a gift from his earthly possessions.
Abel so trusts God, that he gives <em>himself</em>
to him. Cain defers to God sufficiently to make a
<em>present</em> to him. The one shows unbounded faith; the
other shows a measure of affectionate reverence. It is
the same practical difference as that which distinguished
Ruth from Orpah, when the testing time of their love
for their mother-in-law, Naomi, had come to them
alike. “And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law; but
Ruth clave unto her.”<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> No wonder that God counted
Abel’s unstinted proffer of himself, in faith, an acceptable
sacrifice, and received it, as in inter-communion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
on the basis of inter-union; while Cain’s paltry gift,
without any proffer of himself, won no approval from
the Lord.</p>

<p class="indent">Then there followed the unhallowed shedding of
Abel’s blood by Cain, and the crying out, as it were,
of the spilled life of Abel unto its Divine Author.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>
“The voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from
the ground,” said the Lord, to the guilty spiller of
blood. “And now cursed art thou from the ground,
which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s
blood from thy hand.” Here, as elsewhere, the blood
is preeminently the life; and even when poured out
on the earth, the blood does not lose its vitality. It
still has its intelligent relations to its Author and
Guardian;<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> as the world has been accustomed to
count a possibility, down to modern times.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<p class="indent">After the destruction of mankind by the deluge,
when God would begin anew, as it were, by the revivifying
of the world, through the vestige of blood&mdash;of
life&mdash;preserved in the ark,<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> he laid new emphasis
on the sacredness of blood, as the representative of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
that life which is the essence of God himself. Noah’s
first act, on coming out from the ark, was to proffer
himself and all living flesh, in a fresh blood-covenant
with the Lord. “And Noah builded an altar unto the
Lord; and took of every clean beast, and of every
clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.”<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>
From all that we know of the method of the burnt-offering,
either from the Bible-text or from outside
sources, it has, from the beginning, included the preliminary
offering of the blood&mdash;as the life&mdash;to Deity,
by its outpouring, around, or upon, the altar, with or
without the accompaniment of libations of wine; or,
again, by its sprinkling upon the altar.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p>

<p class="indent">It was then, when the spirit of Noah, in this covenant-seeking
by blood, was recognized approvingly by
the Lord, that the Lord smelled the sweet savor of
the proffered offering,&mdash;“the savor of satisfaction, or delectation,”<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>
to him, was in it,&mdash;and he established a new
covenant with Noah, giving commandment anew concerning
the never-failing sacredness of blood: “Every
moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; as [freely
as] the green herb, have I given you all [flesh]. But
flesh with the <em>life</em> thereof, which is the <em>blood</em> thereof
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
[flesh with the blood in it], shall ye not eat. And
surely your blood, the blood of your lives, will I require;
at the hand of every beast will I require it:
and at the hand of man, even at the hand of every
man’s brother, will I require the life of man. Whoso
sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed:
for in the image of God made he man.”<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> Here, the
blood of even those animals whose flesh might be
eaten by man, is forbidden for food: because it is life
itself, and therefore sacred to the Author of life.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> And
the blood of man must not be shed by man,&mdash;except
where man is made God’s minister of justice,&mdash;because
man is formed in the image of God, and only God has
a right to take away&mdash;directly or by his minister&mdash;the
life, from one bearing God’s likeness.</p>

<p class="indent">And this injunction, together with this covenant,
preceded the ceremonial law of Moses; and it survived
that law, as well. When the question came up
in the apostolic conference at Jerusalem, on the occasion
of the visit of Paul and Barnabas, concerning the
duty of Gentile Christians to the Mosaic ceremonial
law, the decision was explicit, that while nothing
which was of that ritual alone should be imposed as
obligatory on the new believers, those essential elements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
of religious observance which were prior to
Moses, and which were not done away with in Christ,
should be emphasized in all the extending domain of
Christianity. Spirituality in worship, personal purity,
and the holding sacred to God, all blood&mdash;or life&mdash;as
the gift of God, and as the means of communion with
God, must never be ignored in the realm of Christian
duty. “Write unto them, that they abstain from the
pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from
what is strangled, and from blood,”<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> said the Apostle
James, in announcing the decision of this conference;
and the circular letter to the Gentile churches was
framed accordingly. Nor does this commandment seem
ever to have been abrogated, in letter or in spirit. However
poorly observed by Christians, it stands to-day as it
stood in the days of Paul, and in the days of Noah, a perpetual
obligation, with all its manifold teachings of the
blessed benefits of the covenant of blood.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>


<h3><a name="lec3_3" id="lec3_3"></a>3. THE BLOOD COVENANT IN CIRCUMCISION.</h3>

<p class="indent">Again the Lord made a new beginning for the race,
in his start with Abraham, as the father of a chosen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and peculiar people in the world. And again the
covenant of blood, or the covenant of strong-friendship
as it is still called in the East, was the prominent
feature in this beginning. The Apostle James says,
that “Abraham ... was called the friend of
God.”<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> God himself, speaking through Isaiah, refers
to Abraham, as “Abraham my friend”;<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> and Jehoshaphat,
in his extremity, calling upon God for help,
speaks of “Abraham, thy friend.”<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> And this application
of the term “friend” to any human being, in his
relations to God, is absolutely unique in the case of
Abraham, in all the Old Testament record. Abraham,
and only Abraham, was called “the friend of God.”<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>
Yet the immediate narrative of Abraham’s relations to
God, makes no specific mention of this unique term
“friend,” as being then applied to Abraham. It is
only as we recognize the primitive rite of blood-friendship
in the incidents of that narrative, that we
perceive clearly why and how God’s covenant with
Abraham was preeminently a covenant of friendship.</p>

<p class="indent">“I will make<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> my covenant between me and thee,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and will multiply thee exceedingly,” said the Lord to
Abraham.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> And again, “I will establish my covenant
between me and thee and thy seed after thee throughout
their generations for an everlasting covenant, to
be a God unto thee; and to thy seed after thee....
And as for thee, thou shalt keep my covenant, thou,
and thy seed after thee throughout their generations.”<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>
And then there came the explanation, how
Abraham was to enter into the covenant of blood-friendship
with the Lord; so that he might be called
“the friend of God.” “This is my covenant, which
ye shall keep, between me and you, and thy seed
after thee; every male among you shall be circumcised.
And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of
your foreskin; and it shall be a token of a covenant
betwixt me and you.”<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> The blood-covenant
of friendship shall be consummated by your giving
to me of your personal blood at the very source of
paternity&mdash;“under your girdle”;<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> thereby pledging
yourself to me, and pledging, also, to me, those who
shall come after you in the line of natural descent.
“And my covenant [this covenant of blood-friendship]
shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.”<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

<p class="indent">So, “in the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised,”
and thenceforward he bore in his flesh the evidence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
that he had entered into the blood-covenant of friendship
with the Lord.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> To this day, indeed, Abraham is
designated in all the East, as distinctively, “Khaleel-Allah,”
“the Friend of God,” or “Ibrâheem el-Khaleel,”
“Abraham the Friend”<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>&mdash;the one Friend, of God.</p>

<p class="indent">When a Jewish child is circumcised, it is commonly
said of him, that he is caused “to enter into the covenant
of Abraham”; and, his god-father, or sponsor, is
called <i>Baal-bereeth</i>,<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> “Master of the covenant.”<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> Moreover,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
even down to modern times, the rite of circumcision
has included a recognition, however unconscious,
of the primitive blood-friendship rite, by the custom of
the ecclesiastical operator, as God’s representative, receiving
into his mouth, and thereby being made a partaker
of, the blood mingled with wine, according to the
method described among the Orientals, in the rite of
blood-friendship, from the earliest days of history.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p class="indent">It is a peculiarity of the primitive compact of blood-friendship,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
that he who would enter into it must be
ready to make a complete surrender of himself, in loving
trust, to him with whom he covenants. He must,
in fact, so love and trust, as to be willing to merge
his separate individuality, in the dual personality of
which he becomes an integral part. Only he who believes
in another unreservedly and fearlessly, can take
such a step intelligently. The record concerning
Abraham stands: “He believed in the Lord; and He
counted it to him for righteousness.”<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> The Hebrew
word, <i>heëmeen</i> (<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">&#1492;&#1462;&#1488;&#1457;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1503;</span>) here translated “believed in,”
carries the idea of an unqualified committal of self to
another. It is from the root <i>aman</i> (<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1503;</span>) with the
two-fold idea of “to be faithful” and “to trust.”<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> Its
correspondent in the Arabic, (<i>amana</i>, <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">امن</span>) carries
the same double idea, of a confident and an entire
committal of self to another, in trust and in trustworthiness.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>
Lane’s definition<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> of the substantive
from this root is: “The becoming true to the trust,
with respect to which God has confided in one, by a
firm believing of the heart.”<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> Abraham so trusted the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Lord, that he was ready to commit himself to the
Lord, as in the rite of blood-friendship. Therefore
the Lord counted Abraham’s spirit of loving and
longing trust, as the equivalent of a spiritual likeness
with himself; and the Lord received Abraham, by his
circumcision, into the covenant of blood-friendship.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>
Or, as the Apostle James states it: “Abraham believed
[in] God, and it was reckoned unto him for
righteousness; and he was called the friend of God.”<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>
Here is the doctrine of “imputation,” with real life in
it; in lieu of a hard commercial transaction, as some
have viewed it.</p>

<p class="indent">The recognition of the covenant of blood in the rite
of circumcision, throws light on an obscure passage
in the life of Moses, as recorded in Exodus 4 : 20-26.
Moses, himself a child of the covenant, had neglected
the circumcision of his own first-born; and so he had
been unfaithful to the covenant of Abraham. While
on his way from the Wilderness of Sinai to Egypt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
with a message from God to Pharaoh, concerning the
un-covenanted first-born of the Egyptians,<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> Moses was
met by a startling providence, and came face to face
with death&mdash;possibly with a bloody death of some
sort. “The Lord met him, and sought to kill him,”
it is said. It seems to have been perceived, both by
Moses and his wife, that they were being cut off
from a farther share in God’s covenant-plans for
the descendants of Abraham, because of their failure
to conform to their obligations in the covenant of
Abraham.</p>

<p class="indent">“Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin
of her son, and cast it at [made it touch] his
[Moses’] feet; and she said, Surely a bridegroom of
blood [one newly bound through blood], art thou to
me. So He [the Lord] let him [Moses] alone [He
spared him, as one newly true to the covenant of
Abraham, and newly safe within its bounds]. Then
she [Zipporah] said [again], A bridegroom of blood
art thou, because of the circumcision;” or, as the
margin renders it: “A bridegroom of blood [art thou]
in regard of the circumcision.”<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The Hebrew word, <i>khathan</i> (<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">&#1495;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1503;</span>), here translated
“bridegroom,” has, as its root idea, the binding through
severing, the covenanting by blood;<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> an idea that is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
in the marriage-rite, as the Orientals view it,<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> and that
is in the rite of circumcision, also. Indeed, in the
Arabic, the corresponding term (<i>khatan</i>, <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">ختن</span>), is applied
interchangeably to one who is a relation by the
way of one’s wife, and to one who is circumcised.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>
Hence, the words of Zipporah would imply that, by
this rite of circumcision, she and her child were
brought into blood-covenant relations with the descendants
of Abraham, and her husband also was now
saved to that covenant; whereas before they were in
danger of being covenanted with a bloody death. It
is this idea which seems to be in the Targum of Onkelos,
where it renders Zipporah’s first word: “By the
blood of this circumcision, a <i>khathna</i> [a blood-won
relation] is given to us;” and her second speech: “If
the blood of this circumcision had not been given [to
us; then we had had] a <i>khathna</i> [a blood-won relation]
of slaughter [of death].” It is as though Zipporah
had said: “We are now newly covenanted to each
other, and to God, by blood; whereas, but for this, we
should have been covenanted to slaughter [or death]
by blood.”</p>

<h3><a name="lec3_4" id="lec3_4"></a>4. THE BLOOD COVENANT TESTED.</h3>
<p class="indent">After the formal covenant of blood had been made between
Abraham and Jehovah, there was a specific testing
of Abraham’s fidelity to that covenant, as if in evidence
of the fact that it was no empty ceremony on his part,
whereby he pledged his blood,&mdash;his very life, in its successive
generations,&mdash;to Jehovah, in the rite of circumcision.
The declaration of his “faith,” and the promise
of his faithfulness, were to be justified, in their manifest
sincerity, by his explicit “works” in their direction.</p>

<p class="indent">All the world over, men who were in the covenant of
blood-friendship were ready,&mdash;or were supposed to be
ready,&mdash;to give not only their lives for each other, but
even to give, for each other, that which was dearer to
them than life itself. And, all the world over, men who
pledged their devotedness to their gods were ready to
surrender to their gods that which they held as dearest
and most precious&mdash;even to the extent of their life, and
of that which was dearer than life. Would Abraham do
as much for his Divine Friend, as men would do for their
human friends? Would Abraham surrender to his God
all that the worshipers of other gods were willing to
surrender in proof of their devotedness? These were
questions yet to be answered before the world.</p>

<p class="indent">“And it came to pass after these things, that God
did prove Abraham [did put him to the test, or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
proof, of his friendship], and said unto him, Abraham;
and he said, Here am I. And he said, Take now thy
son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and
get thee unto the land of Moriah; and offer him there
for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which
I will tell thee of.”<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> And Abraham rose up instantly
to respond to the call of his Divine Friend.</p>

<p class="indent">Just here it is important to consider two or three
points at which the Western mind has commonly failed
to recognize the Oriental thought, in connection with
such a transaction as this.</p>

<p class="indent">An Oriental father prizes an only son’s life far more
than he prizes his own. He recognizes it, to be sure,
as at his own disposal; but he would rather surrender
any other possession than that. For an Oriental to
die without a son, is a terrible thought.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> His life is a
failure. His future is blank. But with a son to take
his place, an Oriental is, in a sense, ready to die.
When therefore an Oriental has one son, if the choice
must be between the cutting short of the father’s life,
or of the son’s, the former would be the lesser surrender;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the latter would be far greater. Preeminently
did this truth have force in the case of Abraham,
whose pilgrim-life had been wholly with reference to
the future; and whose earthly-joy and earthly-hopes
centered in Isaac, the son of his old age. For Abraham
to have surrendered his own toil-worn life, now that
a son of promise was born to him, would have been a
minor matter, at the call of God. But for Abraham to
surrender that son, and so to become again a childless,
hopeless old man, was a very different matter.
Only a faith that would neither question nor reason,
only a love that would neither fail nor waver, could
meet an issue like that. The surrender of an only
son by an Oriental, was not, therefore, as it is often
deemed in the Western mind, a father’s selfish yielding
of a lesser substitute for himself;<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> but it was the giving
of the one thing which he had power to surrender,
which was more precious to him than himself. The
difference here is as great as that between the enforced
sending, by an able-bodied citizen, of a “substitute”
defender of the sender’s country in a war-time draft,
and the willing sending to the front, by an aged
father, of his loved and only son, at the first signal of
his country’s danger. The one case has in it more
than a suggestion of cowardly shirking; the other
shows only a loyal and self-forgetful love of country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Again, we are liable to think of the surrender of a
life, as the dooming to death; and of a sacrificial outpouring
of blood, as necessarily an expiatory offering.
In the case of the only son sent into battle by his
patriotic father, death may be an incident to the transaction;
but the gift of the son is the gift of his <em>life</em>,
whether he shall live or die. And although the war
itself be caused by sin, and be a result, and so a punishment,
of sin, the son is sent into it, not in order that he
may bear punishment, but that he may avert its disastrous
consequences, even at the cost of his life&mdash;with
the necessity of his death.</p>

<p class="indent">This idea of the surrender of an only son, not in expiation
of guilt, but in proof of unselfish and limitless
affection, runs down through the ages, apart from any
apparent trace of connection with the tradition of
Abraham and Isaac. It is seen:&mdash;in India, in the story
of the sacrifice of Siralen, the only son of Sirutunden
and Vanagata-ananga, as a simple proof of their loving
devotedness to Vishnoo;<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> in Arabia, in the story of
the proffered slaying of the two only children of a king,
in order to restore to life by their blood, his dearly loved
friend and servant, who had been turned to stone;<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> in
the Norseland, in the similar story of the king and his
friend and servant “Faithful John;”<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> in Great Britain, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
the story of Amys and Amylion, the one of these friends
sacrificing his two only children for the purpose of
curing the other friend of the leprosy;<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> and so in many
another guise.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> Whatever other value attaches to these
legends, they show most clearly, that the conception of
such a surrender as that to which Abraham was called
in the sacrifice of Isaac, was not a mere outgrowth of the
customs of human sacrifices to malignant divinities, in
Phoenicia and Moab and the adjoining countries, in the
days of Abraham and earlier.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> There was a sentiment
involved, which is everywhere recognized as the noblest
and purest of which humanity is capable.</p>

<p class="indent">If, indeed, there were any reluctance to accept this
simple explanation of an obvious view of the test of
friendship to which God subjected Abraham, because
of its possible bearing on the recognized symbolism
of the transaction, then it would be sufficient to remember,
that one view of such a transaction is not necessarily
its only view. Whatever other view be taken of the
fact and the symbolism of God’s call on Abraham, to
surrender to him his only son, it is obvious that, as a
fact, God did test, or prove, Abraham his friend, by
asking of him the very evidence of his loving and unselfish
devotedness to him, which has been, everywhere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
and always, reckoned the highest and surest evidence
possible of the truest and holiest friendship. And this
may well be looked at, also, as a symbol of God’s
purpose of surrendering <em>his</em> only Son, in proof of
his fidelity to his blood-covenant of friendship with
Abraham and Abraham’s true seed forever.</p>

<p class="indent">“Greater love [in friendship] hath no man than this,
that a man lay down his life for his friends;”<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> and no
man, as the Oriental mind views it, can so utterly lay
down his life, as when he lays down the larger life of
his only son. Abraham showed himself capable of
even such friendship as this, in his blood-covenant with
Jehovah; and when he had manifested his spirit
of devotedness, he was told to stay his hand and
spare his son: the will was accepted for the deed.
“Yea, he that had gladly received the promises, was
offering up his only begotten son; even he of whom
it was said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called: accounting
that God is able to raise up even from the dead;
from whence he did also in a parable receive him
back.”<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> Then it was, that “the Angel of the Lord
called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven and
said, By myself have I sworn [by my life], saith the
Lord, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not
withheld thy son, thine only son: that in blessing I
will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which
is upon the seashore; and thy seed shall possess the
gate of his enemies; and in thy seed shall all the
nations of the earth be blessed: because thou hast
[even to this extent] obeyed my voice.”<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> The blood-covenant
of friendship between Jehovah and Abraham
had more meaning in it than ever, through its testing
and its triumph, in this transaction.</p>

<p class="indent">And it is on this record, and apparently in this view
of the record, that the Apostle James says: “Was
not Abraham our father justified by works, in that he
offered up Isaac his son upon the altar? Thou seest
that faith wrought with his works, and by works was
faith made perfect [consummated]; and the Scripture
was fulfilled which saith, And Abraham believed God,
and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness; and
he was called the friend of God.”<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p>


<h3><a name="lec3_5" id="lec3_5"></a>5. THE BLOOD COVENANT AND ITS TOKENS IN THE
PASSOVER.</h3>

<p class="indent">There came, again, a time when the Lord would
give fresh evidence of <em>his</em> fidelity to his covenant of
blood-friendship with Abraham. Again, a new start
was to be made in the history of redemption. The
seed of Abraham was in Egypt, and the Lord would
bring thence that seed, for its promised inheritance in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Canaan. The Egyptians refused to let Israel go, at
the call of the Lord. The Lord sent a series of strokes,
or “plagues” upon the Egyptians, to enforce their
obedience to his summons. And first, he turned the
waters of Egypt into blood; so that there was nothing
for the Egyptians to drink save that which, as the
representative of life, was sacred to their gods, and
must not be tasted.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> So on, from “plague” to “plague”&mdash;from
stroke to stroke; until the Lord’s sentence went
forth against all the uncovenanted first-born of Egypt.
Then it was, that the Lord gave another illustration of
the binding force of the unfailing covenant of blood.</p>

<p class="indent">In the original covenant of blood-friendship, between
Abraham and the Lord, it was Abraham who gave of
his blood in token of the covenant. Now, the Lord
was to give of his blood, by substitution, in re-affirmation
of that covenant, with the seed of Abraham his
friend. So the Lord commanded the choice of a lamb,
“without blemish, a male of the first year”;<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> typical
in its qualities, and representative in its selection. The
blood of that lamb was to be put “on the two side
posts and on the lintel” of every house of a descendant
of Abraham; above and along side of every
passer through the doorway.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> “And the blood shall
be to you for a token upon the houses where ye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
are,” said the Lord to this people: “and when I see
the blood [the token of my blood-covenant with Abraham],
I will pass over you, and there shall no plague
be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of
Egypt.”<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The flesh of the chosen lamb was to be eaten by
the Israelites, reverently, as an indication of that inter-communion
which the blood-friendship rite secures;
and in accordance with a common custom of the
primitive blood-covenant rite, everywhere.</p>

<p class="indent">To this day, as I can testify from personal observation,
the Samaritans on Mount Gerizim (where alone
in all the world the passover-blood is now shed, year
by year), bring to mind the blood-covenant aspects of
this rite, by their uses of that sacred blood. The
spurting life-blood of the consecrated lambs is caught
in basins, as it flows from their cut throats; and not
only are all the tents promptly marked with the blood
as a covenant-token, but every child of the covenant
receives also a blood-mark, on his forehead, between
his eyes,<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> in evidence of his relation to God in the
covenant of blood-friendship.</p>

<p class="indent">It will be remembered that in the primitive rite of
blood-friendship a blood-stained record of the covenant
is preserved in a small leathern case, to be worn
as an amulet upon the arm, or about the neck, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
him who has won a friend forever in this sacred rite.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>
It would even seem that this was the custom in ancient
Egypt, where the red amulet, which represented the
blood of Isis, was worn by those who claimed a blood-friendship
with the gods.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> It is a noteworthy fact, that
it was in conjunction with the institution of this passover
rite of the Lord’s blood-friendship with Israel, as
a permanent ceremonial, that the Lord declared of this
rite and its token: “It shall be for a sign upon thine
hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes.”<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> And it is
on the strength of this injunction, that the Jews have,
to this day, been accustomed to wear upon their foreheads,
and again upon their arm&mdash;as a crown and as
an armlet&mdash;a small leathern case, as a sacred amulet,
or as a “phylactery”; containing a record of the passover-covenant
between the Lord and the seed of Abraham
his friend. Not the law itself, but the substance
of the covenant between the Lawgiver and his people,
was the text of this amulet record. It included
Exodus 13 : 3-10, 11-16, with its reference to God’s
deliverance of his people from bondage, to the institution
of the passover feast, and to the consecration of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the redeemed first-born; also Deuteronomy 6 : 4-9,
13-22, with its injunction to entire and unswerving
fidelity, in the covenant thus memorialized.</p>

<p class="indent">The incalculable importance of the symbolism of
the phylacteries, in the estimation of the Lord’s people,
has been recognized, as a fact, by both Jewish and
Christian scholars, even after their primary meaning
has been lost sight of&mdash;through a strange dropping
out of sight of the primitive rite of blood-covenanting,
so familiar in the land of Egypt and in the earlier and
later homes of the Hebrews. The Rabbis even held
that God himself, as the other party in this blood-covenant,
wore the phylacteries, as its token and
memorial.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> Among other passages in support of this,
they cited Isaiah 49 : 16: “Behold I have graven
thee upon the palms of my hands”; and Isaiah 62 :
8: “The Lord hath sworn by his right hand, and by
the arm of his strength.” Farrar, referring to this
claim of the Rabbis, says, “it may have had some
mystic meaning”;<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> and certainly the claim corresponds
singularly with the thought and with the customs
of the rite of blood-covenanting. To this day
many of the Syrian Arabs swear, as a final and a
most sacred oath, by their own blood&mdash;as their own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
life;<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> and in making the covenant of blood-friendship
they draw the blood from the upper arm, because, as
they explain it, the arm is their strength.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> The cry
of the Egyptian soul to his god, in his resting on the
covenant of blood, was, “Give me your arm; I am
made as ye.”<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> It is not strange, therefore, that those
who had the combined traditions of Egypt and of
Syria, should see a suggestion of the covenant of
blood-friendship in the inspired assurance: “The
Lord hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm
of his strength.” It is by no means improbable,
indeed, that the universal custom of lifting up the arm
to God in a solemn oath<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> was a suggestion of swearing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
by one’s blood, by proffering it in its strength, as
in the inviolable covenant of sacred friendship with
God. So, again, in the “striking hands” as a form of
sacred covenanting<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>; the clasping of hands, in blood.</p>

<p class="indent">The Egyptian amulet of blood-friendship was red,
as representing the blood of the gods. The Egyptian
word for “red,” sometimes stood for “blood.”<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> The
sacred directions in the Book of the Dead were written
in red;<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> hence, follows our word “rubrics.” The Rabbis
say, that when persecution forbade the wearing of the
phylacteries with safety, a red thread might be substituted
for this token of the covenant with the Lord.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>
It was a red thread which Joshua gave to Rahab as a
token of her covenant relations with the people of the
Lord.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> The red thread, in China, to-day, as has
been already shown, binds the double cup, from which
the bride and bridegroom drink their covenant draught
of “wedding wine”; as if in symbolism of the covenant
of blood.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> And it is a red thread which in India,
to-day, is used to bind a sacred amulet around the
arm or the neck.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> Among the American Indians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
“scarlet, or red,” is the color which stands for sacrifices,
or for sacrificial blood, in all their picture painting;
and the shrine, or <i>tunkan</i>, which continues to
have its devotees, “is painted red, as a sign of active
[or living] worship.”<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> The same is true of the
shrines in India;<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> the color red shows that worship is
still living there; red continues to stand for blood.</p>

<p class="indent">The two covenant tokens of blood-friendship with
God&mdash;circumcision and the phylacteries&mdash;are, by the
Rabbis, closely linked in their relative importance.
“Not every Israelite is a Jew,” they say, “except he
has two witnesses&mdash;the sign of circumcision and phylacteries”;<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>
the sign given to Abraham, and the sign
given to Moses.</p>

<p class="indent">In the narration of King Saul’s death, as given in
2 Samuel 1 : 1-16, the young Amalekite, who reports
Saul’s death to David, says: “I took the crown that
was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm
[the emblems of his royalty], and have brought them
hither unto my lord.” The Rabbis, in their paraphrasing
of this passage,<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> claim that it was the phylactery,
“the frontlet” (<i>totephta</i>) rather than a “bracelet,” which
was on the arm of King Saul; as if the king of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
covenant-people of Jehovah would not fail to be without
the token of Jehovah’s covenant with that people.</p>

<p class="indent">So firmly fixed was the idea of the appropriateness
and the binding force of these tokens of the covenant,
that their use, in one form or another, was continued
by Christians, until the custom was denounced by
representative theologians and by a Church Council.
In the Catacombs of Rome, there have been found
“small caskets of gold, or other metal, for containing
a portion of the Gospels, generally part of the first
chapter of John [with its covenant promises to all who
believe on the true Paschal Lamb], which were worn
on the neck,” as in imitation of the Jewish phylacteries.
These covenant tokens were condemned by Irenæus,
Augustine, Chrysostom, and by the Council of
Laodicea, as a relic of heathenism.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>


<h3><a name="lec3_6" id="lec3_6"></a>6. THE BLOOD COVENANT AT SINAI.</h3>

<p class="indent">When rescued Israel had reached Mount Sinai, and
a new era for the descendants of Abraham was entered
upon, by the issue of the divinely given charter
of a separate nationality, the covenant of blood-friendship
between the Lord and the seed of the Lord’s
friend, was once more recognized and celebrated.
“And Moses came and told the people all the words
of the Lord, and all the judgments: and all the people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
answered with one voice, and said, All the words
which the Lord hath spoken will we do. And Moses
wrote all the words of the Lord, and rose up early in
the morning [or, ‘prepared for a new start’ as that
phrase means],<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> and builded an altar under the mount,
and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of
Israel. And he sent young men of the children of
Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed
peace offerings of oxen unto the Lord;” not sin-offerings
are named, but burnt-offerings, of consecration, and
peace-offerings, of communion. And now observe the
celebration of the symbolic rite of the blood-covenant
between the Lord and the Lord’s people, with the
substitute blood accepted on both sides, and with the
covenant record agreed upon. “And Moses took half
of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the
blood he sprinkled on the altar. And he took the
book [the record] of the covenant, and read in the audience
of the people: and they said, All that the Lord
hath spoken will we do, and be obedient. And Moses
took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people [half
of it he sprinkled on the Lord’s altar, and half of it
he sprinkled on the Lord’s people. The writer of
Hebrews<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> says that Moses sprinkled blood on the
book, also; thus blood-staining the record of the covenant,
according to the custom in the East, to-day],
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
and [Moses] said, Behold the blood of the covenant,
which the Lord hath made with you concerning all
these words [or, as the margin renders it, ‘upon all
these conditions,’ in the written compact]. Then
went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and
seventy of the elders of Israel.... And they
beheld God, and did eat and drink”;<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> as in the social
inter-communion, which commonly accompanies the
rite of blood-friendship.</p>

<p class="indent">When Abraham was brought into the covenant of
blood-friendship with Jehovah, it was his own blood
which Abraham devoted to Jehovah. When Jehovah
recognized anew this covenant of blood-friendship
in behalf of the seed of his friend, Jehovah provided
the substitute blood, for its symbolizing in the passover.
When united Israel was to be inducted into the privileges
of this covenant of blood-friendship at Mount
Sinai, half of the blood came from the one party, and
half of the blood came from the other party, to the
sacred compact; both portions being supplied from a
common and a mutually accepted symbolic substitute.</p>


<h3><a name="lec3_7" id="lec3_7"></a>7. THE BLOOD COVENANT IN THE MOSAIC RITUAL.</h3>

<p class="indent">With the establishment of the Mosaic law, there
was an added emphasis laid on the sacredness of
blood, which had been insisted on in the Noachic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
covenant; and many new illustrations were divinely
given of the possibilities of an ultimate union with
God through inter-flowing blood, and of present communion
with God through the sharing of the substitute
flesh of a sacrificial victim.</p>

<p class="indent">“Ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of
fowl or beast, in any of your dwellings. Whosoever
it be that eateth any blood, that soul shall be cut off
from his people.”<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> “Whatsoever man there be of the
house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among
them, that eateth any manner of blood; I will set my
face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut
him off from among his people. For the life [the
soul] of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it
to you upon the altar to make atonement for your
souls: for it is the blood that maketh atonement by
reason of the life [by reason of its being the life].
Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul
of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that
is among you eat blood.”<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> “For as to the life of all
flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the life thereof;
therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall
eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all
flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be
cut off.”<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Because of sin, death has passed upon man. Man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
can have new life only from the Author of life. A
transfusion of life is, as it were, a transfusion of blood;
for, “of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the
life thereof.” If, indeed, the death-possessed man
could enter into a blood-covenant with the Author of
life,&mdash;could share the life of him who is Life,&mdash;then
the dead might have new life in a new nature; and the
far separated sinner might be brought into oneness
with God; finding atonement in the cleansing flow of
the new blood thus applied. So it pleased God to appoint
substitute blood upon the altar of witness between
the sinner and Himself, as a symbol of that atonement
whereby the sinner might, through faith, become a
partaker of the divine nature. “The wages of sin is
death; but the free gift of God is eternal life”<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>&mdash;in
that foreshadowed divine blood, which the blood of
beasts, offered on the altar, can, for a time, typify.
Blood&mdash;even the blood of beasts&mdash;thus made sacred,
as a holy symbol, must never be counted as a common
thing; but it must be held, ever reverently, as a token
of that life which is the sinner’s need; and which is
God’s grandest gift and God’s highest prerogative.</p>

<p class="indent">In the line of this teaching, the command went
forth: “What man soever there be of the house of
Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat in the
camp, or that killeth it without the camp, and hath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
not brought it unto the door of the tent of meeting, to
offer it [with its blood] as an oblation unto the Lord
before the tabernacle of the Lord: blood shall be
imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood [improperly];
and that man shall be cut off from among his
people: to the end that the children of Israel may
bring their sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open
field, even that they may bring them unto the Lord,
unto the door of the tent of meeting, unto the priest,
and sacrifice them for sacrifices of peace-offering unto
the Lord. And the priest shall sprinkle the blood
upon the altar of the Lord at the door of the tent of
meeting; and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the
Lord.”<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> The children of Israel were, at all times and
everywhere, to reach out after communion and union
with God, through the surrender of their personal
selves in the surrender of their substitute blood&mdash;with
its divinely appointed symbolism of communion and
union with God “in the blood of the eternal covenant”
of divine friendship.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></p>

<p class="indent">And again: “Whatsoever man there be of the
children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn
among them, which taketh in hunting any beast or
fowl that may be eaten; he shall pour out the blood
thereof, and cover it with the dust.”<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> If he be at a
distance from the tabernacle, so that he cannot bring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the blood for an oblation at the altar, he must, at all
events, reverently pour out the blood as unto God,
and cover it as he would a human body in a grave.
And to this day this custom prevails widely throughout
the East; not among Jews alone, but among
Christians and Muhammadans, as also among those
of other religions.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Under the Mosaic ritual, the forms and the symbolisms
of sacrifice were various. But through them all,
where blood was an element,&mdash;in the sin-offering, in
the trespass-offering, in the burnt-offering, in the
peace-offering,&mdash;blood always represented life, never
death. Death was essential to its securing; but, when
secured, blood was life. Death, as the inevitable
wages of sin, had already passed unto all men; and
“death reigned from Adam to Moses”; but, with the
full disclosure of the law, in Moses, which made sin
apparent, there came, also, a disclosure of an atonement
for sin, and of a cure for its consequences.
Death was already here; now came the assurance of
an attainable life. The sinner, in the very article
of death, was shown that he might turn, in self-surrender
and in loving trust, with a proffer of his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
life, by substitute blood, to God; and that he might
reach out hopefully after inter-union with God, by the
sharing of the divine-nature in the unfailing covenant
of divine-human blood-friendship. Thus “not as the
trespass [with its mere justice of punishment; but] so
also [and ‘much more,’ of grace alone,] is the free gift
[of life to the justly dead].”<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></p>

<p class="indent">All the detailed requirements of the Mosaic ritual,
and all the specific teachings of the Rabbis, as well,
go to show the preeminence of the <em>blood</em> in the sacrificial
offerings; go to show, that it is the <em>life</em> (which the
blood is), and not the <em>death</em> (which is merely necessary
to the securing of the blood), of the victim, that is the
means of atonement; that gives the hope of a sinner’s
new inter-union with God.</p>

<p class="indent">In a commentary on a Talmudic tract, on The Day
of Atonement, Rabbi Obadiah of Barttenora, notes the
fact,<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> that in the choice by lot, of the priests who were
to have a part in the daily sacrifice, the priest <em>first</em>
selected “obtained the right [of priority], and sprinkled
the blood upon the altar, after he had received it in
the vessel for the purpose; for he who sprinkled the
blood [is the one who had] received the blood. The
<em>next</em> priest to him killed the sacrifice, and this notwithstanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
[the fact] that the slaying preceded the receiving
of the blood; because <em>the office of sprinkling
was higher than that of slaying</em>; for the slaying was lawful
if done by a stranger; which was not the case with
the sprinkling.” The death of the victim was a minor
matter: it was the victim’s life,&mdash;its blood which was
its life,&mdash;that had chief value and sacredness.</p>

<p class="indent">On this same point Dr. <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Edersheim</span> says:<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> “The
Talmud declares the offering of birds, so as to secure
the blood [so as to secure that which was preeminently
precious] to have been the most difficult part of a
priest’s work. For the <em>death</em> of the [victim of the]
sacrifice was only a means towards an end; that end
being the shedding and sprinkling of the <em>blood</em>, by
which the atonement was really made. The Rabbis
mention a variety of rules observed by the priest who
caught up the blood&mdash;all designed to make the best
provision for its proper sprinkling. Thus, the priest
was to catch up the blood in a silver vessel pointed at
the bottom, so that it could not be put down; and to
keep it constantly stirred, to preserve the fluidity of
the blood. In the sacrifice of the red heifer, however,
the priest caught the blood directly in his left hand,
and sprinkled it with his right towards the Holy
Place: while in that of the leper, one of the two priests
received the blood in the vessel; the other [received
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
it] in his hand, from which he anointed the purified
leper.”</p>

<p class="indent">Recognizing the truth that in the sacrifices of the
Mosaic ritual, “consecration by blood is consecration
in a living union with Jehovah,” Professor W. Robertson
Smith observes,<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> that, “in the ordinary atoning
sacrifices, the blood is not applied to the people [it is
merely poured out Godward, as if in sign of life surrender];
but in the higher forms, as in the sacrifice for
the whole congregation (Lev. 4 : 13 <i>seq.</i>), the priest at
least dips his hand in it, and so puts the bond of blood
between himself, as the people’s representative, and the
altar, as the point of contact with God.”<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> And so, on
the basis of the root-idea of the primitive rite of the
covenant of blood, an inter-union is symbolized between
the returning sinner and his God.</p>

<p class="indent">The aim of all the Mosaic sacrifices was, a restored
communion with God; and the hope which runs
through them all is of a divine-human inter-union
through blood. “The one purpose which is given after
every sacrifice in the first chapters of Leviticus,”<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> says
Stanley,<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> “is, that it ‘shall make a sweet savour unto the
Lord’.” And <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Edersheim</span> says,<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> of all the various sacrifices
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
of the ritual: “These, were, then, either sacrifices
of communion with God, or else [were] intended to restore
that communion when it had been disturbed or
dimmed through sin and trespass: sacrifices <em>in</em> communion,
or [sacrifices] <em>for</em> communion, with God. To
the former class belong the burnt and the peace-offerings;
to the latter, the sin and the trespass offerings.”<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The sin-offering, of that ritual, was, in a sense, the
basis of the whole system of sacrifices. The chief
feature of that offering, was the out-flowing of its
blood Godward. The offering itself was a substitute-offering,
for an individual or for the entire people. Its
blood was sprinkled upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering,
or poured out at the base of that altar,<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>&mdash;the altar
of personal consecration; or, it was sprinkled within
the Holy Place toward the Most Holy Place,<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>&mdash;the
symbolic dwelling-place of Jehovah: and again it was
made to touch the horns of the altar of incense, which
sent up its sweet savor to God: in every case, it was
the outreaching of the sinner toward inter-union with
God, in a covenant of blood.</p>

<p class="indent">The whole burnt-offering, of the Mosaic ritual,
symbolised the entire surrender to God, of the individual
or of the congregation, in covenant faithfulness;
the giving of one’s self in unreserved trust to Him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
with whom the offerer desired to be in loving oneness.
It was an indication of a readiness to enter fully into
that inter-union, which the blood-covenant brought
about between two who had been separated, but who
were henceforth to be as one. This offering also must
be made with blood; for it is blood&mdash;which is the
life&mdash;that gives the possibility of inter-union. All the
outpoured blood of this offering, however, went directly
to the altar upon which the offering itself was laid;<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> not
toward the Most Holy Place, of the Lord’s symbolic
presence. This offering was not, indeed, understood
as in itself compassing inter-union; it indicated rather
a desire and a readiness for inter-union&mdash;anew or
renewed: so, both the substitute-body and the substitute-blood
were offered at the altar of typical surrender and
consecration. When other sacrifices were brought, the
burnt-offering followed the sin-offering, but preceded
the peace-offering;<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> again, it might be offered by itself.
He who was of the blood-covenant stock of Abraham,
thereby sought restoration to the full privileges of that
covenant, to which he had not been wholly true; and
even he who was not of that stock might in this way
show his desire to share in its privileges; “for the burnt
offering was the only sacrifice which non-Israelites were
permitted to bring”<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> to the altar of Jehovah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Following the communion-seeking, or the union-seeking,
sin-offering (with its connected, or related,
trespass-offering, or guilt-offering), and the self-surrendering
burnt-offering, there came the joyous communion-symbolizing
peace-offering, with its type of
completed union,<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> in the sharing, by the sinner and his
God, of the flesh of the sacrificial victim at a common
feast. And this banquet-sacrifice<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> corresponds with the
feast of inter-communion which commonly follows the
primitive rite of blood-covenanting, and which marks
the completion of the inter-union thereby sought after.</p>

<p class="indent">All the other sacrifices of the Mosaic ritual follow
in the line of these three classes. Even those which
are in themselves offered without blood, presuppose
the individual’s share in the blood-covenant, by the rite
of circumcision, and through the high priest’s sin-offering
for the entire congregation. “The Rabbis
attach ten comparative degrees of sanctity to sacrifices;
and it is interesting to mark, that of these the first belonged
to the blood of the sin-offering; the second to
the burnt-offering; the third to the sin-offering itself;
and the fourth to the trespass-offering.”<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> The blood
which is to secure the covenant-union&mdash;anew or renewed&mdash;is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
of preeminent importance. Then comes the
symbol of self-surrendering devotedness. First, the
possibility of inter-union; next, the expression of
readiness and desire for it. After this, the other sacrifices
range themselves according to their signification,
until the culmination of the series is reached in the
joyous inter-communion feast of the peace-offering.</p>

<p class="indent">But, with all the suggestions of the rite of blood-covenanting,
in the sacrifices of the Mosaic ritual, there
were limitations in the correspondences of that rite in
those sacrifices, which mark the incompleteness of
their symbolism, and which point to better things to
come. In the primitive blood-covenant rite itself, both
parties receive, and partake of, the blood which becomes
common to the two. In all the outside religions
of the world, where men reach out after a divine-human
inter-union through substitute-blood, the offerer
drinks of the sacrificial blood, or of something which
stands for it; and so he is supposed to share the nature
of the God with whom he thus covenants and inter-unites.
In the Mosaic ritual, however, all drink-offerings
of blood were forbidden to him who would enter
into covenant with God; he might not taste of the
blood. He might, it is true, look forward, by faith, to
an ultimate sharing of the divine nature; and in anticipation
of that inter-union, he could enjoy a symbolic
inter-communion with God, by partaking of the peace-offerings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
at the table of his Lord; but as yet the sacrificial
offering which could supply to his death-smitten
nature the vivifying blood of an everlasting covenant,
was not disclosed to him.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Even the substitute blood which he presented at the
altar, as he came with his outreaching after a blood-covenant
union with the Lord, did not secure to him
direct personal access to the symbolic earthly dwelling-place
of the Lord. That blood could be poured out at
the base of the altar of consecration, or it could be
sprinkled upon its horns. That blood could, on occasions
be sprinkled before the veil of the Most Holy
Place; or could touch the horns of the altar of sweet
incense. But that blood could never pass that veil
which guarded the place of the Lord’s symbolic
presence, save once in a year when the high-priest, all
by himself, and that not without a show of his own
unfitness for the mission, went in thither, to sprinkle
the substitute blood before the mercy-seat; “the Holy
Ghost this signifying, that the way into the Holy Place
hath not yet been manifest<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>”; that the substitute
“blood of bulls and of goats”<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> cannot be a means of
man’s inter-union with God.</p>

<p class="indent">Lest, indeed, the Israelite should believe that a blood-covenant
union was really secured with God, rather
than typified, through these prescribed symbolic sacrifices
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
and their sharing, he was repeatedly warned
against that fatal error, and was taught that his true
covenanting must be by a faith-filled recognition of the
symbolism of these substitute agencies; and by the implicit
surrender of himself, in loving trust, to Him who
had ordained them as symbols. Thus in the Psalms:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

the symbols themselves, the same prophet gives assurance
of better things in store for all those who are

<p>And so, all the way along through the prophets, in
repeated emphasis of the incompleteness of the blood-covenanting
symbols in the ritual sacrifices.</p>

<p class="indent">Concerning the very rite of circumcision, which was
the token of Abraham’s covenant of blood-friendship
with the Lord, the Israelites were taught that its spiritual
value was not in the formal surrender of a bit of
flesh, and a few drops of blood, in ceremonial devotedness
to God, but in its symbolism of the implicit
surrender of the whole life and being, in hearty covenant
with God. “Behold, unto the Lord thy God
belongeth the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, the
earth with all that therein is. Only the Lord had a
delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their
seed after them, even you above all peoples as at this
day. Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart,
and be no more stiff-necked.”<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> “And it shall come to
pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the
blessings and the curse which I have set before thee, and
thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations,
whither the Lord thy God hath driven thee, and shalt return
unto the Lord thy God, and shalt obey his voice
according to all that I command thee this day, thou
and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy
soul; that then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity,
and have compassion upon thee, and will return and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
gather thee from all the peoples, whither the Lord thy
God hath scattered thee.... And the Lord thy
God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy
seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart,
and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.”<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> And

circumcised in heart,<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> shall be in the covenant
of blood-friendship with God.</p>

<p class="indent">So, also, with the phylacteries, as the record of the
blood-covenant of the passover, they had a value only
as they represented a heart-remembrance of that covenant,
by their wearers. Says Solomon, in the guise
of Wisdom.</p>

<p class="indent">The blood-covenant symbols of the Mosaic law, all
pointed to the possibility of a union of man’s spiritual
nature with God; but they did not in themselves either
assure or indicate that union as already accomplished;
nor did they point the way to it, as yet made clear.
They were only “a shadow of the things to come.”<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Another gleam of the primitive truth, that blood is
life and not death, and that the transference of blood
is the transference of life, is found in the various Mosaic
references to the <i>goel</i> (<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">&#1490;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;</span>), the person who is authorized
to obtain blood for blood as an act of justice, in
the East. And another proof of the prevailing error
in the Western mind, through confounding blood with
death, and justice with punishment, is the common
rendering of the term <i>goel</i>, as “avenger,”<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> or “revenger,”<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>
in our English Bible, wherever that term
applies to the balancing of a blood account; although
the same Hebrew word is in other connections commonly
translated “redeemer,”<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> or “ransomer.”<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Lexicographers are confused over the original import
of the word <i>goel</i>;<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> all the more, because of this
confusion in their minds over the import of blood, in
its relation to death and to justice. But it is agreed
on all hands, that, as a term, the word was, in the East,
applied to that kinsman whose duty it was to secure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
justice to the injured, and to restore, as it were, a normal
balance to the disturbed family relations. <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Oehler</span>
well defines the goel, as “that particular relative whose
special duty it was to restore the violated family integrity,
who had to redeem not only landed property that
had been alienated from the family (Lev. 25 : 25 ff.), or a
member of the family that [who] had fallen into slavery
(Lev. 25 : 47 ff.), but also the blood that had been taken
away from the family by murder.”<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> Hence, in the event
of a depletion of the family by the loss of blood&mdash;the loss
of a life&mdash;the goel had a responsibility of securing to the
family an equivalent of that loss, by other blood, or by
an agreed payment for its value. His mission was not
vengeance, but equity. He was not an avenger, but a
redeemer, a restorer, a balancer. And in that light, and
in that light alone, are all the Oriental customs in connection
with blood-cancelling seen to be consistent.</p>

<p class="indent">All through the East, there are regularly fixed tariffs
for blood-cancelling; as if in recognition of the relative
loss to a family, of one or another of its supporting
members.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> This idea, of the differences in ransoming-value
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
between different members of the family,
is recognized, in the Mosaic standards of ritual-ransom;<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>
although the accepting of a ransom for the
blood of a blood-spiller was specifically forbidden in
the Mosaic law.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> This prohibition, in itself, however,
seems to be a limitation of the privileges of the goel,
as before understood in the East. The Qurân, on the
other hand, formally authorizes the settlement of manslaughter
damages by proper payments.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Throughout Arabia, and Syria, and in various parts
of Africa,<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> the first question to be considered in any
case of unlawful blood-shedding is, whether the loss
life shall be restored&mdash;or balanced&mdash;by blood, or by
some equivalent of blood. <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Von Wrede</span>, says of the
custom of the Arabs, in concluding a peace, after tribal
hostilities: “If one party has more slain than the other,
the shaykh on whose side the advantage lies, says [to
the other shaykh]: ‘Choose between blood and milk’
[between life, and the means of sustaining life]; which
is as much as to say, that he may [either] avenge the
fallen [take life for life]; or accept blood-money.”<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>
Mrs. Finn says, similarly, of the close of a combat in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Palestine: “A computation is generally made of the
losses on either side by death, wounds, etc., and the
balance is paid to the victors.”<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> Burton describes similarly
the custom in Arabia.<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></p>

<p class="indent">It is the same in individual cases, as in tribal conflicts.
An accepted payment for blood fully restores
the balance between the aggrieved parties and the
slayer. As <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pierotti</span> says: “This charm will teach the
Arab to grasp readily the hands of the slayer of his
father or his son, saying, ‘Such an one has killed my
father, but he has paid me the price of his blood.’”<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>
This in itself shows, that it is not revenge, but restitution,
that is sought after by the goel; that he is not
the blood-avenger, but the blood-balancer.</p>

<p class="indent">It is true that, still, in some instances, all money payment
for blood is refused; but the avowed motive in
such a case is the holding of life as above price&mdash;the
very idea which the Mosaic law emphasized. Thus
Burton tells of the excited Bed´ween mother who dashes
the proffered blood-money to the ground, swearing
“by Allah, that she will not eat her son’s blood.”<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> And
even where the blood of the slayer is insisted on, there
are often found indications that the purpose of this
choice rests on the primitive belief that the lost life is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
made good to the depleted family by the newly received
blood.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> Thus, in the region of Abyssinia, the
blood of the slayer is drunk by the relatives of the one
first slain;<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> and, in Palestine, when the goel has shed
the blood of an unlawful slayer, those who were the
losers of blood by that slayer dip their handkerchiefs
in his blood, and so obtain their portion of his life.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a></p>

<p class="indent">In short, apart from the specific guards thrown
around the mission of the goel, in the interests of justice,
by the requirements of the Mosaic law, it is evident,
that the primal idea of the goel’s mission was to
restore life for life, or to secure the adjusted equivalent
of a lost life; not to wreak vengeance, nor yet to mete
out punishment. The calling of the goel, in our English
Bible, a “revenger” of blood, is a result of the
wide-spread and deep-rooted error concerning the
primitive and Oriental idea of blood and its value;
and that unfortunate translation tends to the perpetuation
of this error.</p>


<h3><a name="lec3_8" id="lec3_8"></a>8. THE PRIMITIVE RITE ILLUSTRATED.</h3>

<p class="indent">Because the primitive rite of blood-covenanting was
well known in the Lands of the Bible, at the time of
the writing of the Bible, for that very reason, we are
not to look to the Bible for a specific explanation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the rite itself, even where there are incidental references
in the Bible to the rite and its observances; but, on
the other hand, we are to find an explanation of the
biblical illustrations of the primitive rite, in the understanding
of that rite which we gain from outside
sources. In this way, we are enabled to see in the
Bible much that otherwise would be lost sight of.</p>

<p class="indent">The word for “covenant,” in the Hebrew, <i>bereeth</i>
(<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;</span>), is commonly so employed, in the sacred text,
as to have the apparent meaning of a thing “cut,” as
apart from, or as in addition to, its primary meaning
of a thing “eaten.”<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> This fact has been a source of
confusion to lexicographers.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> But, when we consider
that the primitive rite of blood-covenanting was by
cutting into the flesh in order to the tasting of the
blood, and that a feast was always an accompaniment
of the rite, if, indeed, it were not an integral portion
of it, the two-fold meaning of “cutting” and “eating”
attaches obviously to the term “covenant”; as the
terms “carving,” and “giving to eat,” are often used
interchangeably, with reference to dining; or as we
speak of a “cut of beef” as the portion for a table.</p>

<p class="indent">The earliest Bible reference to a specific covenant
between individuals, is in the mention, at Genesis
14 : 13, of Mamre, Eshcol, and Aner, the Amorites,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
who were in covenant with&mdash;literally, were “masters
of the covenant of”&mdash;“Abram the Hebrew.” After
this, comes the record of a covenant between Abraham
and Abimelech, at the wells of Beer-sheba. Abimelech
sought that covenant; he sought it because of his
faith in Abraham’s God. “God is with thee in all that
thou doest,” he said: “Now, therefore, swear unto me
here by God, that thou wilt not deal falsely with me,
nor with my son, nor with my son’s son: but according
to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou
shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast
sojourned. And Abraham said, I will swear.”<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> Then
came the giving of gifts by Abraham, according to the
practice which seems universal in connection with this
rite, in our own day.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> “And Abraham took sheep
and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech.” And they
two “made a covenant,”&mdash;or, as the Hebrew is, “they
two cut a covenant.” This covenant, thus cut between
Abraham and Abimelech&mdash;patriarchs and sovereigns as
they were&mdash;was for themselves and for their posterity.
As to the manner of its making, we have a right to
infer, from all that we know of the manner of such
covenant-making among the people of their part of the
world, in the earliest days of recorded history.</p>

<p class="indent">Herodotus, who goes back more than two-thirds of
the way to Abraham, says, that when the Arabians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
would covenant together, a third man, standing between
the two, cuts, with a sharp stone, the inside of
the hands of both, and lets the blood therefrom drop
on seven stones which are between the two parties.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>
Phicol, the captain of Abimelech’s host, was present,
as a third man, when the covenant was cut between
Abimelech and Abraham; at Beer-sheba&mdash;the Well
of the Seven, or the Well of the Oath.<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> Instead of
seven stones as a “heap of witness”<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> between the two
in this covenanting, “seven ewe lambs” were set apart
by Abraham, that they might “be a witness”<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a>&mdash;a symbolic
witness to this transaction.</p>

<p class="indent">In the primitive rite of blood-covenanting, as it is
practised in some parts of the East, to the present
time, in addition to other symbolic witnesses of the
rite, a <em>tree</em> is planted by the covenanting parties, “which
remains and grows as a witness of their contract.”<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> So
it was, in the days of Abraham. “And Abraham
planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and called
there on the name of the Everlasting God. And
Abraham sojourned [was a sojourner] in the land of
the Philistines many days”<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>&mdash;while that tree, doubtless,
remained and grew as a witness of his blood-covenant
compact with Abimelech the ruler of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Philistines.<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a>
Abimelech was, as it were, the first-fruits
of the “nations”<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> who were to have a blessing through
the covenanted friend of God.</p>

<p class="indent">It is a noteworthy fact, that when Herodotus describes
the Scythians’ mode of drinking each other’s
mingled blood, in their covenanting, he tells of their
“cutting covenant” by “striking the body” of the covenanting
party. In this case, he employs the words
<i>tamnomenon</i> (<i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ταμνομένων</i>) “cutting,” and <i>tupsantes</i>
(<i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τύψαντες</i>) “striking,” which are the correspondents, on
the one hand of the Hebrew <i>karath</i> (<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1514;</span>) “to cut,”
and on the other hand of the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ferire</i>, “to strike;”
as applied to covenant making.<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> And this would
seem to make a tri-lingual “Rosetta Stone” of this
statement by Herodotus, as showing that the Hebrew
“cutting” of the covenant, and the Latin “striking”
of the covenant, is the Greek, the Arabian, the
Scythian, and the universal primitive, method of covenanting,
by cutting into, or by striking, the flesh of a
person covenanting; in order that another may become
a possessor of his blood, and a partaker of his life.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet later, at the same Well of the Seven, another
Abimelech came down from Gerar, with “Ahuzzath
his friend, and Phicol the captain of his host,” and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
prompted by faith, sought a renewal of the covenant
with the house of Abraham.<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> It is not specifically
declared that Abimelech and Isaac <em>cut</em> a covenant together;
but it is said that “they did eat and drink” in
token of their covenant relations, and that they “sware
one to another.”<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> Apparently they either cut a new
covenant, or they confirmed one which their fathers
had cut.</p>

<p class="indent">When Jacob and Laban covenanted together, in “the
mountain [the hill-country] of Gilead,” before their
final separation, they had their stone-heap of witness
between them; such as Herodotus says the Arabs
were accustomed to anoint with their own blood, in
their covenanting by blood, in his day;<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> for Jacob, perhaps,
had more tolerance than Abraham, for perverted
religious symbols.<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> “And now let us cut a covenant, I
and thou,” said Laban; “and let it be for a witness
between me and thee. And Jacob took a stone, and
set it up for a pillar [a pillar instead of a tree]. And
Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they
took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there
on the heap [the Revisers have translated this, <em>by</em> the
heap].<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha: but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Jacob called it Gilead. And Laban said, This heap is
witness between me and thee this day.... God
is witness betwixt me and thee.... The God of
Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their
father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the
Fear of his father Isaac. And Jacob offered a sacrifice
in the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread:
and they did eat bread.”<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> Here again, the cutting of
the covenant, and the sharing of a feast in connection
with the rite,&mdash;the “cutting” and the “eating”&mdash;are in
accordance with all that we know of the primitive rite,
of blood-covenanting in the East, in earlier and in
later times.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet more explicit is the description of the blood-covenanting
which brought into loving unity, David
and Jonathan. It was when the faith-filled heroism
of the stripling shepherd-boy was thrilling all Israel
with grateful admiration, that David was brought into
the royal presence of Saul, and of Saul’s more than
royal hero-son, Jonathan, to receive the thanks of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
king for the rescue of the tarnished honor of the
Israelitish host. Modestly, David gave answer to the
question of the king. “And it came to pass, when he
had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul
of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and
Jonathan loved him as his own soul.” “Then Jonathan
and David cut a covenant, because he [Jonathan]
loved him [David] as his own soul [as his own life, his
own blood].”<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> Then followed that gift of raiment and
of arms which was a frequent accompaniment of blood-covenanting.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>
“And Jonathan stripped himself of the
robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his
apparel, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his
girdle.”<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> From that hour the hearts of David and
Jonathan were as one. Jonathan could turn away from
father and mother, and could repress all personal ambition,
and all purely selfish longings, in proof of his
loving fidelity to him who was dear to him as his own
blood.<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> His love for David was “wonderful, passing
the love of women.”<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Nor was this loving compact between Jonathan and
David for themselves alone. It was for their posterity
as well.<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> “The Lord be with thee, as he hath been
with my father,” said Jonathan. “And thou shalt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the
Lord, that I die not: but also thou shalt not cut off
thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not [even]
when the Lord hath cut off the enemies of David every
one from the face of the earth. So Jonathan cut a
covenant with the house of David, saying [as in the
imprecations of a blood-covenant], And the Lord shall
require it [fidelity to this covenant] at the hand of
David’s enemies. And Jonathan caused David to
swear again, for the love he had to him: for he loved
him as he loved his own soul [his own life, his own
blood].”<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> And years afterward, when the Lord had
given David rest from all his enemies around about him,
the memory of that blood-covenant pledge came back
to him; “and David said, Is there yet any that is left
of the house of Saul, that I may shew him kindness
for Jonathan’s sake?”<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> The seating of lame Mephibosheth
at David’s royal table,<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> was an illustration of
the unfailing obligation of the primitive covenant of
blood; which had bound together David and Jonathan,
for themselves and for theirs forever.</p>


<h3><a name="lec3_9" id="lec3_9"></a>9. THE BLOOD COVENANT IN THE GOSPELS.</h3>

<p class="indent">And now from David, to David’s greater Son; from
type to anti-type; from symbol and prophecy, to reality
and fruition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Death had passed upon all men. Yet in the hearts
of the death-smitten there was still a longing for life.
Sin-leprous souls yearned for that in-flow of new being,
which could come only through inter-union with
the divine nature, in oneness of life with the Author
and Source of all life. Revelation and prophecy had
assured the possibility and the hope of such inter-union.
Rite and ceremony and symbol, the wide-world
over, signified man’s desire, and man’s expectation,
of covenanted access to God, through personal
surrender, and through life-giving, life-representing
blood.</p>

<p class="indent">But, where men yielded up unauthorized offerings,
even of their own blood, or of the very lives of their
first-born, they confessed themselves unsatisfied with
their attitude God-ward; and, where men followed a
divinely prescribed ritual, they were taught by that
very ritual itself, that the outpoured blood and the partaken
flesh of the sacrifices were, at the best, but mere
shadows of good things to come.<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> The whole creation
was groaning and travailing in pain together, until
the birth of the world’s promised redemption.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The symbolic covenant of blood-friendship was between
God and Abraham’s seed; and in that seed were
all the nations of the earth to have a blessing. God
had called on Abraham to surrender to him his only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
son, in proof of his unfailing love; and, when Abraham
had stood that test of his faith, God had spared to him
the proffered offering. It now remained for God to
transcend Abraham’s proof of friendship, and to spare
not his own and only Son,<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> but to make him a sacrificial
offering, by means of which the covenant of
blood-friendship, between God and the true seed of
Abraham, might become a reality instead of a symbol.
Abraham had given to God of his own blood, by the
rite of circumcision, in token of his desire for inter-union
with God. God was now to give of his blood,
in the blood of his Son, for the re-vivifying of the sons
of Abraham in “the blood of the eternal covenant.”<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Then, in the fullness of time, there came down into
this world He who from the beginning was one with
God, and who now became one with man. Becoming
a sharer of the nature of those who were subject to
death, and who longed for life, Jesus Christ was here
among men as the fulfillment of type and prophecy;
to meet and to satisfy the holiest and the uttermost
yearnings of the human soul after eternal life, in communion
and union with God. “And the Word became
flesh, and dwelt among us, ... full of grace and
truth.” “In him was life [life that death could not
destroy; life that could destroy death], and the life
[which was in him] was the light [the guide and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
hope] of men.” “He came unto his own, and they
that were [called] his own received him not. But as
many as received him [whether, before, they had been
called his own, or not] to them gave he the right to
become children of God [by becoming partakers of his
life], even to them that believe on his name: which
were [through faith] begotten, not of bloods [not by
ordinary generation], nor of the will of the flesh, nor
of the will of man, but of God.”<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> Having in his own
blood, the life of God and the life of man, Jesus Christ
could make men sharers of the divine nature, by
making them sharers of his own nature; and this was
the truth of truths which he declared to those whom
he instructed.</p>

<p class="indent">In the primitive rite of blood-covenanting, men
drank of each other’s blood, in order that they might
have a common life; and they ate together of a
mutually prepared feast, in order that they might
evidence and nourish that common life. In the outreaching
of men Godward, for the privileges of a
divine-human inter-union, they poured out the substitute
blood of a chosen victim in sacrifice, and they
partook of the flesh of that sacrificial victim, in symbolism
of sharing the life and the nourishment of
Deity. This symbolism was made a reality in Jesus
Christ. He was the Seed of Abraham; the fulfillment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
of the promise, “In Isaac shall thy Seed be called.”<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a>
He was the true Paschal Lamb; the “Lamb without
blemish and without spot”;<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> “the Lamb that hath
been slain from the foundation of the world.”<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> The
blood which he yielded, was Life itself. The body
which he laid on the altar was the Peace Offering of
Completion.<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a></p>

<p class="indent">“Wherefore, when he cometh into the world, he saith:</p>

<div class="poetry">

</div>
</div>

<p>Saying above, [He here says,] Sacrifices and offerings
and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou
wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein [as if in
themselves sufficient] (the which are offered according
to the Law); then [also] hath he said, Lo I am come to
do thy will. He taketh away the first [the symbolic],
that he may establish the second [the real].”<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></p>

<p class="indent">He was here, in the body of his blood and flesh, for
the yielding of his blood and the sharing of his flesh,
in order to make partakers of his nature, whosoever
would seek a divine-human inter-union and a divine-human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
inter-communion, through the sacrifice made
by him, “once for all.”</p>

<p class="indent">“Jesus therefore said unto them, Verily, verily, I
say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of
man and drink his blood, ye have not life in yourselves.
He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my
blood hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the
last day. For my flesh is meat indeed [is true meat],
and my blood [my life] is drink indeed [is true drink].
He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood
abideth in me, and I in him [Herein is communion
through union]. As the living Father sent me, and I
live because of the Father; so he that eateth me, he
also shall live because of me. This is the bread
which came down out of heaven: not as the fathers
did eat, and died: he that eateth this bread shall live
forever.”<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a></p>

<p class="indent">“These things said he in the synagogue, as he
taught in Capernaum”&mdash;toward the close of the second
year of his public ministry. The fact that he did
speak thus, so long before he had instituted the
Memorial Supper, has been a puzzle to many commentators
who were unfamiliar with the primitive rite
of blood-covenanting, and with the world-wide series
of substitute sacrifices and substitute forms of communion,
which had grown out of the suggestions, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
out of the perversions, of the root symbolisms of that
rite. But, in the light of all these customs, the words
of Jesus have a clearer meaning. It was as though
he had said: “Men everywhere long for life. They
seek a share in the life of God. They give of their
own blood, or of substitute blood, and they taste of
substitute blood, or they receive its touch, in evidence
of their desire for oneness of nature with God. They
crave communion with God, and they eat of the flesh
of their sacrifices accordingly. All that they thus
reach out after, I supply. In me is life. If they will
become partakers of my life, of my nature, they shall
be sharers of the life of God.” Then, he added, in
assurance of the fact, that it was a profound spiritual
truth which he was enunciating: “It is the spirit that
quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words
that I have spoken unto you are spirit, and are life.”<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a>
The divine-human inter-union and the divine-human
inter-communion are spiritual, and they are spiritually
wrought; or they are nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">The words of Jesus on this subject, were not understood
by those who heard him. “The Jews therefore
strove one with another, saying, How can this man
give us his flesh to eat?”<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> But this was not because
the Jews had never heard of eating the flesh of a sacrificial
victim, and of drinking blood in a sacred covenant:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
it was, rather, because they did not realize that Jesus
was to be the crowning sacrifice for the human race;
nor did they comprehend his right and power to make
those who were one with him through faith, thereby
one with God in spiritual nature. “Many,” even “of
his disciples, when they heard” these words of his,
“said, This is a hard saying; who can hear it?”<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a>
Nor are questioners at this point, lacking among his
disciples to-day.</p>

<p class="indent">Before Jesus Christ was formally made an offering
in sacrifice, as a means of man’s inter-union and inter-communion
with God, there were two illustrations of
his mission, in the giving of his blood for the bringing
of man into right relations with God. These were,
his circumcision, and his agony in Gethsemane.</p>

<p class="indent">By his circumcision, Jesus brought his humanity
into the blood-covenant which was between God and
the seed of God’s friend, Abraham, of whose nature,
according to the flesh, Jesus had become a partaker;<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a>
Jesus thereby pledged his own blood in fidelity to that
covenant; so that all who should thereafter become
his by their faith, might, through him, be heirs of faithful
Abraham.<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> The sweet singer of the Christian

<p class="indent">In Gethsemane, the sins and the needs of humanity
so pressed upon the burdened soul of Jesus, that his
very life was forced out, as it were, from his aching,
breaking heart, in his boundless sympathy with his
loved ones, and in his infinite longings for their union
with God, through their union with himself, in the
covenant of blood he was consummating in their behalf.<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>
“And being in an agony, he prayed more earnestly:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>

<p class="indent">Because of his God-ward purpose of bringing men
into a loving covenant with God, Jesus gave of his
blood in the covenant-rite of circumcision. Because
of his man-ward sympathy with the needs and the
trials of those whom he had come to save, and because
of the crushing burden of their death-bringing sins,
Jesus gave of his blood in an agony of intercessory suffering.
Therefore it is, that the Litany cry of the ages
goes up to him in fulness of meaning: “By the mystery
of thy holy incarnation; by thy holy nativity and
circumcision; ... by thine agony and bloody sweat,
... Good Lord, deliver us.”</p>

<p class="indent">In process of time, the hour drew nigh that the true
covenant of blood between God and man should be
consummated finally, in its perfectness. The period
chosen was the passover-feast&mdash;the feast observed by
the Jews in commemoration of that blood-covenanting
occasion in Egypt, when God evidenced anew his
fidelity to his promises to the seed of Abraham, his
blood-covenanted friend. “Now before the feast of
the passover, Jesus knowing that his hour was come
that he should depart out of this world to the Father,
having loved his own which were in the world, he
loved them unto the end.”<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> “And when the hour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>

he actually partook of the passover meal at that time,
or not is a point still in dispute;<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> but as to that which
follows, there is no question.</p>

<p class="indent">“As they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed,

my blood of the covenant,”<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> or, as another Evangelist
records, “this cup is the new covenant in my blood,”<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a>
“which is shed for many unto remission of sins”<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>
[unto the putting away of sins]. “This do, as oft as
ye drink it, in remembrance of me.”<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> “And they all
drank of it.”<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Here was the covenant of blood; here was the
communion feast, in partaking of the flesh of the
fitting and accepted sacrifice;&mdash;toward which all rite
and symbol, and all heart yearning and inspired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
prophecy, had pointed, in all the ages. Here was the
realization of promise and hope and longing, in man’s
possibility of inter-union with God through a common
life&mdash;which is oneness of blood; and in man’s inter-communion
with God, through participation in the
blessings of a common table. He who could speak
for God, here proffered of his own blood, to make
those whom he loved, of the same nature with himself,
and so of the same nature with his God; to bring them
into blood-friendship with their God; and he proffered
of his own body, to supply them with soul nourishment,
in that Bread which came down from God.</p>

<p class="indent">Then it was, while they were there together in that
upper room, for the consummating of that blood-covenant
of friendship, that Jesus said to his disciples:
“Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay
down his life for his friends. Ye are my friends, if ye
do the things which I command you. No longer do I
call you servants; for the servant knoweth not what
his lord doeth: but I have called you friends [friends
in the covenant of blood-friendship now]; for all
things that I heard from my Father, I have made
known unto you.”<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> A common life, through oneness
of blood, secures an absolute unreserve of intimacy;
so that neither friend has aught to conceal from his
other self. “Abide in me, and I in you; ... for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
apart from me ye can do nothing,” was the injunction
of Jesus to his blood-covenant friends, at this hour of
his covenant pledging. “If ye abide in me, and my
words abide in you, ask whatsoever ye will, and it
shall be done unto you.”<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Then it was, also, that the prayer of Jesus for his
new blood-covenant friends went up: “Father, the
hour is come; glorify thy Son, that the Son may
glorify thee: even as thou gavest him authority over
all flesh, that whatsoever [whomsoever] thou hast
given him, to them he should give eternal life [in an
eternal covenant of blood]. And this is life eternal,
that they should know thee the only true God, and
him whom thou didst send [as the means of life], even
Jesus Christ.... Holy Father, keep them in thy
name which thou hast given me, that they may be one,
even as we are.... Neither for these [here present]
only do I pray, but for them also that believe on me
through their word; that they may all be one; even
as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they
also may be in us: that the world may believe that
thou didst send me. And the glory which thou hast
given me I have given unto them; that they may be
one, even as we are one; I in them, and thou in me,
that they may be perfected into one; that the world
may know that thou didst send me, and lovedst them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
even as thou lovedst me.”<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> Here was declared the
scope of this blood-covenant, and here was unfolded
its doctrine.</p>

<p class="indent">It was not an utterly new symbolism that Jesus was
introducing into the religious thought of the world: it
was rather a new meaning that he was introducing
into, or that he was disclosing in, an already widely
recognized symbolism. The world was familiar with
the shadow of truth; Jesus now made clear to the
world, the truth’s substance. Man’s longing to be a
partaker of the divine nature, had manifested itself,
through all the ages and everywhere. Jesus now
showed how that longing of death-smitten man could
be realized. “The appearing of our Saviour Jesus
Christ ... abolished death, and brought life and
immortality to light through the gospel”<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> of his blood-covenant.</p>

<p class="indent">But a covenant of blood, a covenant to give one’s
blood, one’s life, for the saving of another, cannot be
consummated without the death of the covenanter.
“For where [such] a covenant is, there must of necessity
be [be brought] the death of him that made it.
For [such] a covenant is of force [becomes a reality]
where there hath been death [or, over the dead]: for
doth it [such a covenant] ever avail [can it be efficient]
while he that made it liveth?”<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> Jesus had said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
“Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay
down his life for his friends.”<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> Of his readiness to
show this measure of love for those who were as the
sheep of his fold, he had declared: “I came that they
may have life, and may have it abundantly....
I lay down my life for the sheep.... Therefore
doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life,
that I may take it again. No one taketh it away from
me, but I lay it down of myself.”<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> And again: “I
am the living bread which came down out of heaven:
if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever:
yea, and the bread which I will give is my flesh, for
the life of the world.”<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> “For my flesh is meat indeed,
and my blood is drink indeed.”<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> Such a covenant as
this, could be of force only through the death of him
who pledges it.</p>

<p class="indent">The promise of the covenanting-cup, at the covenanting-feast,
was made good on Calvary.<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> The pierced
hands and feet of the Divine Friend yielded their life-giving
streams. Then, with the final cry, “It is finished,”
the very heart of the self-surrendered sacrificial victim
was broken,<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> and the life of the Son of God and of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Seed of Abraham, was poured out unto death,<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> in order
that all who would, might become sharers in its re-vivifying
and saving power. He who was without sin, had
received the wages of sin; because, that, only through
dying was it possible for him to supply that life which
would redeem from the penalty of sin those who had
earned death, as sin’s wages.<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> He who, in himself, had
life, had laid down his life, so that those who were without
life might become its partakers, through faith, in the
bonds and blessings of an everlasting covenant. So,
the long symbolized covenant of blood was made a
reality. “And the witness is this, that God gave unto
us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath
the Son hath the life; he that hath not the Son of God
hath not the life.”<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a></p>


<h3><a name="lec3_10" id="lec3_10"></a>10. THE BLOOD COVENANT APPLIED.</h3>

<p class="indent">Under the symbolic sacrifices of the Old Covenant,
it was the <em>blood</em> which made atonement for the soul.
It was not the death of the victim, nor yet its broken
body, but it was the blood, the life, the soul, that was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
made the means of a soul’s ransom, of its rescue, of its
redemption. “The life [the soul] of the flesh is in the
blood,” said the Lord: “and I have given it to you
upon the altar to make atonement [to be a cover, to
be a propitiation] for your souls [for your lives]: for it
is the blood that maketh atonement by reason [of its
being] the life [the soul].”<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> “For as to the life [the
soul] of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the
life [the soul] thereof.”<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> And so, all through the
record of the Old Covenant.</p>

<p class="indent">It is the same in the New Covenant, as it was in the
Old. Atonement, salvation, rescue, redemption, is by
the blood, the life, of Christ; not by his death as such;
not by his broken body in itself; but by that blood
which was given at the inevitable cost of his broken
body and of his death. The figure of leprosy and its
attempted cure by blood, may tend to make this truth
the clearer. In the leper, the very blood itself&mdash;the
life&mdash;was death smitten. The only hope of a cure was
by purging out the old blood, by means of an inflowing
current of new blood, which was new life.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> To
give this blood, the giver himself must die; but it was
his blood, his life, not his death, which was to be the
means of cure. So, also, with the sin-leprous nature.
His old life must be purged out, by the incoming of a
new life; of such a life as only the Son of God can supply.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
In order to supply that blood, its Giver must himself
die, and so be a sharer of the punishment of sin, although
he was himself without sin. Thus was the new
life made a possibility to all, by faith.</p>

<p class="indent">So it is, that “we have redemption [rescue from
death] through [by means of] his blood”;<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> and that
“the blood of Jesus ... cleanseth us [by its purging
inflow] from all sin.”<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> So it is, that he “loosed us
[freed us] from our sins by his [cleansing, his re-vivifying]
blood.”<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> So it is, that “if any man is in Christ
[is one in nature with Christ, through sharing, by faith,
the blood of Christ], he is a new creature [Of course
he is]: the old things are passed away; behold they
are become new.”<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> So it is, also, that it can be said
of those whose old lives were purged away by the inflowing
redeeming life of Christ: “Ye died, and your
life is hid with Christ in God.”<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> And “this is the true
God and eternal life.”<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a></p>

<p class="indent">“These things have I written unto you,” says the
best loved of the disciples of Jesus, “that ye may know
that ye have eternal life; even unto you that believe on
the name of the Son of God”;<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> “that ye may believe
that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that, believing,
ye may have life in his name.”<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> For “God
commendeth his own love toward us, in that, while we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
were yet sinners, Christ died for us [while we were
separated from God by sin, God yielded his only Son,
to give his blood, at the cost of his death, as a means
of our inter-union with God]. Much more then, being
now justified by [or, in] his blood [being brought into
inter-union with God by that blood], shall we be saved
from the wrath of God [against sin] through him [in
whom we have life]. For if, while we were enemies,
we were reconciled to God [restored to union with
God] through the [blood-giving] death of his Son,
much more, being [thus] reconciled, shall we be saved
by [or, in] his life.”<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a></p>

<p class="indent">All who will, may, now, “be partakers of the divine
nature,”<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> through becoming one with Christ, by sharing
his blood, and by being nourished with his body.
Entering into the divine-human covenant of blood-friendship,
which Christ’s death has made possible,
the believer can be so incorporated with Christ, by
faith, as to identify himself with the experience and
the hopes of the world’s Redeemer; and even to say,
in all confidence: “I have been crucified with Christ;
yet I live; and yet no longer I, but Christ liveth in
me; and that life which I now live in the flesh, I live
in faith, the faith which is in [which centres in] the Son
of God, who loved me and gave himself up for me.”<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>
“For as the Father hath life in himself, even so gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
he to the Son also to have life in himself.”<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> And “it
was the good pleasure of the Father that in him [the
Son] should all the fulness dwell; and through him
to reconcile all things unto himself, having made
peace [having completed union] through the blood of
his cross”<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a>&mdash;in the bonds of an everlasting covenant&mdash;between
those who before were separated by sin.</p>

<p class="indent">“Remember, that aforetime ye, the Gentiles in the
flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that [people]
which is called Circumcision, in the flesh, made by
hands,&mdash;that ye were at that time separate from Christ,
alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and
strangers from the covenants of the promise, having
no hope and without God in the world. But now in
Christ Jesus ye that once were far off are made nigh
in the blood of Christ. For he is our peace, who
made both [Jew and Gentile] one, and broke down the
middle wall of partition, having abolished in his flesh
the enmity, even the law of commandments contained
in ordinances; that he might create in himself of the
twain one new man, so making peace; and might
reconcile them both in one body unto God through
the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: and he
came and preached peace to you that were far off, and
peace to them that were nigh: for through them we
both have our access in one Spirit unto the Father.”<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
“For in him [Christ] dwelleth all the fulness of the
Godhead bodily, and in him ye are made full, who is
the head of all principality and power: in whom ye
were also circumcised with a circumcision not made
with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh,
in the circumcision of Christ.”<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> “For ye all are one
man in Christ Jesus. And if ye are Christ’s, then are
ye Abraham’s seed, heirs according to promise”<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a>&mdash;inheritors
of the blood-covenant promises of God to
Abraham his friend.</p>

<p class="indent">No longer is there a barrier between the yearning,
loving, trusting heart, and the mercy-seat of reconciliation
in the very presence of God. We who share the
body and the blood of Christ, by faith, are one with
him in all the privileges of his Sonship. “For by one
offering he hath perfected [hath completed in their
right to be sharers with him] for ever, them that are
sanctified [that are devoted, that are consecrated, to
him]. And the Holy Ghost also beareth witness to

<p>then saith he,</p>

a Great Priest over the house of God; let us draw near
with a true heart in fulness of faith, having our hearts
sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our body

is where we share the presence of Him in whom

<h3 class="no-break"><a name="app_1" id="app_1"></a>IMPORTANCE OF THIS RITE STRANGELY UNDERVALUED.</h3>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> seems strange that a primitive rite like the blood-covenant, with
its world-wide sweep, and its manifold applications to the history of
sacrifice, should have received so little attention from students of the
latter theme. Nor has it been entirely ignored by them; although its
illustrations have, in this connection, been drawn almost entirely from
the field of the classic writers, where its religious aspects have a
minor prominence; and, as a result, the suggestion of any real importance
in the religious symbolism of this rite has been, generally, brushed
aside without its receiving due consideration.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus, in The Speaker’s Commentary,&mdash;which is one of the more
recent, and more valuable, scholarly and sensible compends of sound
and thorough biblical criticism,&mdash;there are references to the rite of
human blood-covenanting in its possible bearing on the blood-covenanting
of God with Israel before Mount Sinai,<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> after this sort: “The
instances from classical antiquity, adduced, as parallels to this
sacrifice of Moses, by <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bähr</span>, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Knobel</span>, and <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kalisch</span>, in which animals were
slaughtered on the making of covenants, are either, those in which the
animal was slain to signify the punishment due to the party that might
break the covenant (Hom. <cite>Il.</cite>, III., 298; XIX., 252; Liv.
<cite>Hist.</cite>, I., 24; XXI., 45); those in which confederates dipped
their hands, or their weapons, in the same blood (Æsch. <cite>Sept. c.
Theb.</cite>, 43; Xenoph. <cite>Anab.</cite>, II., 2, § 9); or those in which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
contracting parties tasted each other’s blood (Herodot. [<cite>Hist.</cite>]
I., 74; IV., 74; Tac. <cite>Annal.</cite>, XII., 47). All these usages are
based upon ideas which are but very superficially related to the subject;
they have indeed no true connection whatever with the idea of sacrifice
as the seal of a covenant between God and man.”<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a></p>

<p class="indent">When the entire history of man’s outreaching after an inter-union of
natures with his fellow-man and with his God, is fairly studied, in the
light thrown on it by the teachings of the divine-human Being, who gave
of his own blood for the consummation of the longed-for divine-human
inter-union, it will be more clearly seen, whether it were the relation
of the primitive rite itself to the idea of sacrifice, or the study of
that relation, which was “very superficial,” as a cause of its popular
overlooking.</p>

<p class="indent">The closest and most sacred form of covenant ever known in the
primitive world, was that whereby two persons covenanted to become
one, through being partakers of the same blood. At Sinai, when Jehovah
would covenant with Israel, a common supply of substitute blood&mdash;proffered
by Israel and accepted by Jehovah&mdash;was taken; and one-half
of it was cast upon the altar, Godward, while the other half of it
was cast Israelward, upon the people.<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> The declaration of Moses to
Israel, then, was: “Behold the blood of the covenant, which the Lord
hath made with you;” or, as that declaration is repeated, in Hebrews:
“This is the blood of the covenant which God covenanted to you-ward.”<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a>
And from that time forward, the most sacred possession of
Israel,&mdash;above which hovered the visible sign of the presence of
Jehovah,&mdash;was the casket which contained the record of that blood-made
covenant; and it was toward the mercy-seat cover of that Covenant
Casket, that House of the Covenant, that the symbolic blood of atonement
through new life was sprinkled, in the supreme renewals of that
covenant by Israel’s representative year by year.</p>

<p class="indent">Even the Speaker’s Commentary says, of this mutual blood-sharing
by Israel and Jehovah at Sinai: “The blood thus divided between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
two parties to the covenant signified the sacramental union between the
Lord and his people.”<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> Of the blood which was to be poured out on
Calvary, Jesus said: “This is my blood of the [new] covenant, which
is shed for many.”<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> And of the sacramental union which could be
secured, between his trustful disciples and himself, by tasting his
blood, and by being nourished on his flesh, he said: “Except ye eat the
flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye have not life in
yourselves. He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal
life.”<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> It really looks as if there were more than a superficial relation
between the fact of an absolute inter-union of two natures through an
inter-flow of a common life, in the rite of blood-covenanting, and the
sacramental union between the Lord and his people, which was typified in the
blood-covenant at Sinai, and which was consummated in the blood-covenant
at Calvary.</p>

<p class="indent">Herbert Spencer, indeed, seems to have a clearer conception than the
Speaker’s Commentary, of the relation of human blood-covenanting, to
the inter-union of those in the flesh, with spiritual beings. He perceives
that the primitive offerings of blood over the dead, from the living person,
are, in some cases, “explicable as arising from the practice of establishing
a sacred bond between living persons by partaking of each other’s blood:
the derived conception being, that those who give some of their blood to
the ghost of a man just dead and lingering near [and of course, the principle
is the same when the offering of blood is to the gods, thereby] effect
with it a union, which on the one side implies submission, and on the
other side friendliness.”<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> This admission by Mr. Spencer covers the
essential point in the argument of this entire volume.</p>


<h3><a name="app_2" id="app_2"></a>LIFE IN THE BLOOD, IN THE HEART, IN THE LIVER.</h3>

<p class="indent">Among all primitive peoples, the blood has been deemed the representative
of life. The giving of blood has been counted the giving of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
life. The receiving of blood has been counted the receiving of life.
The sharing of blood has been counted the sharing of life. Hence, the
blood has always been counted the chief thing in any sacrificial victim
proffered to the gods; and whatever was sought through sacrifice, was
to be obtained by means of the blood of the offering. Even though no
specific reference to the blood be found in the preserved descriptions of
one of the earlier sacrifices,&mdash;as, for example, the Akkadian sacrifice of the
first-born (page <a href="#Page_166">166</a>, <i>supra</i>), the very fact that the offering made
was of a <em>life</em>, and that <em>blood</em> was recognized as life, is in
itself the proof that it was the blood which gave the offering its value.</p>

<p class="indent">Sir Gardiner Wilkinson, who was thoroughly familiar with both
Egyptian and biblical antiquities, was impressed by the “striking resemblance”
of many of the religious rites of the Jews to those of Egypt,
“particularly the manner in which the sacrifices were performed;”<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a>
and he points out the Egyptian method of so slaying the sacrificial ox,
that its blood should be fully discharged from the body; a point which
was deemed of such importance in the Jewish ritual.<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> Of the illustration
of this ceremony given by Wilkinson from an ancient Egyptian
painting,<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> the Speaker’s Commentary says: “There is no reason to
doubt that this picture accurately represents the mode pursued in the
court of the [Jewish] Tabernacle.”<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Almost as universal as the recognition of the life in the blood, has
been the identification of the heart as the blood-centre and the blood-fountain,
and so as the epitome of the life itself. Says <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pierret</span>,<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> the
French Egyptologist, concerning the preeminence given to the heart,
by the ancient Egyptians: “The heart was embalmed separately in a
vase placed under the guardianship of the genius Duaoumautew
[rather, Tuau-mut-ef, or, Reverencer of his Mother. ‘My heart was
my mother.’ See page <a href="#Page_99">99</a>, <i>supra</i>] without doubt because this organ,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
indispensable to the resurrection, could not be replaced in the body of a
man, until it had been weighed in the scale of the balance of the
Osirian judgment (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Todtenbuch</cite>, cxxv.); where representing the acts of
the dead, it ought to make equilibrium with the statue of the goddess
Truth [Maat]. (See the framed papyri in the funereal hall of the
Museum of the Louvre.) Indeed the favorable sentence is thus formulated:
‘It is permitted that his heart be in its place.’ It is said to
Setee I., in the temple of Abydos: ‘I bring thee thy heart to thy
breast; I put it in its place.’ The heart, principle of existence and of
regeneration, was symbolized by the scarabæus: it is for this reason that
the texts relative to the heart were inscribed upon the funereal scarabæuses,
which at a certain epoch were introduced into the body of the
mummy itself, to replace the absent organ.”</p>

<p class="indent">The idea that the heart is in itself life, and that it can even live
apart from the body, is found all the world over. References to it in
ancient Egypt, in India, and in primitive America, have already been
pointed out (pages <a href="#Page_100">100</a>-<a href="#Page_110">110</a>, <i>supra</i>). It shows itself, likewise, in the
folk-lore of the Arctic regions, and of South Africa, as well as of the
Norseland. In a Samoyed tale, “seven brothers are in the habit of
taking out their hearts and sleeping without them. A captive damsel,
whose mother they have killed, receives the extracted hearts, and hangs
them on the tent-pole, where they remain till the following morning.
One night her brother contrives to get the hearts into his possession.
Next morning, he takes them into the tent, where he finds the brothers
at the point of death. In vain do they beg for their hearts, which he
flings on the floor. ‘And as he flings down the hearts, the brothers
die.’”<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> According to a Hottentot story, “the heart of a girl, whom a
lion has killed and eaten, is extracted from the lion, and placed in a
calabash filled with milk [the ‘heart’ and ‘milk’; or blood and bread,
life and its nourishment (See pages <a href="#Page_10">10</a>-<a href="#Page_12">12</a>, <a href="#Page_261">261</a> f., <i>supra</i>)]. ‘The calabash
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
increased in size; and, in proportion to this, the girl grew again
inside [of] it.’”<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> “In a Norse story, a giant’s heart lies in an egg,
inside a duck, which swims in a well, in a church, on an island;”<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> and
this story is found in variations in other lands.<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> So, again, in a “Russian
story, a prince is grievously tormented by a witch who has got
hold of his heart, and keeps it perpetually seething in a magic cauldron.”<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a></p>

<p class="indent">This same idea is found in the nomenclature of the Bible, and in the
every day speech of the civilized world of the present age. In more
than nine hundred instances, in our common English Bible, the Hebrew
or the Greek word for “heart,” as a physical organ, is applied to man’s
personality; as if it were, in a sense, synonymous with his life, his self,
his soul, his nature. In every phase of man’s character, of man’s
needs, or of man’s experiences, “heart” is employed by us as significant
of his innermost and realest self. He is “hard-hearted,” “tender-hearted,”
“warm-hearted,” “cold-hearted,” “hearty,” or “heartless.”
His words and his conduct are “heart-touching,” “heart-cheering,”
“heart-searching,” “heart-piercing,” “heart-thrilling,” “heart-soothing,”
or “heart-rending;” and they are a cause, in others, of “heart-burning,”
“heart-aching,” “heart-easing,” or “heart-expanding.” At
times, his “heart is set upon” an object of longing, or again “his
heart is in his mouth” because of his excited anxiety. It may be, that
he shows that “his heart is in the right place,” or that “his heart is at
rest” at all times. The truest union of two young lives, is where “the
heart goes with the hand” in the marriage covenant.</p>

<p class="indent">And so, all the world over, from the beginning, primitive man, in the
lowest state of savagery and in the highest stage of civilization, has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
been accustomed to recognize the truth, and to employ the symbolisms
of speech, which are in accordance with the latest advances of physiological
and psychological science, and with the highest spiritual conceptions
of biblical truth, in our nineteenth Christian century, concerning
the mental, the moral, and the religious needs and possibilities of
the human race. Man as he is needs a “new heart,” a new nature, a
new life; and that need can be supplied by the Author of life, through
that regeneration which is indicated, and which, in a sense, is realized
in new blood which is pure at the start, and which purifies by its purging
inflow. The recognition of this truth, and the outreaching of man
in its direction, are at the basis of all forms of sacrifice in all the ages.
And this wonderful attainment of primitive man everywhere, we are
asked to accept as man’s mere natural inheritance from the sensory
quiverings of his ancestral tadpole!</p>

<p class="indent">“The knowledge of the ancients on the subject [of blood as the
synonym of life] may, indeed, have been based on the mere observation
that an animal loses its life when it loses its blood,” says the Speaker’s
Commentary. But it does seem a little strange, that none of the
ancients ever observed that man is very liable to lose his life when he
loses his <em>brains</em>, and that few animals are actively efficient for practical
service without a <em>head</em>; whereas both men and the lower animals
do lose <em>blood</em> freely without death resulting.</p>

<p class="indent">It is true that in many parts of the world the <em>liver</em> was made prominent
as seemingly a synonym of life; but this was obviously because
of the popular belief that the liver was itself a mass of coagulated
blood. The idea seems to have been that as the heart was the blood-fountain,
the liver was the blood-cistern; and that, as the source of life
(or of blood, which life is,) was at the heart; so, the great receptacle of
life, or of blood, was the liver. Thus, in the classic myth of Prometheus,
the avenging eagle of Jupiter is not permitted to gnaw upon
the life-giving heart itself of the tortured victim, but upon the compacted
body of life in the captive’s liver; the fountain of life is not to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
be destroyed, but the cistern of life is to be emptied daily of all that it
had received from the out-flowing heart during the preceding night.
And in the symbolism of these two organs, the ancients seem to have
been agreed, that “The heart is the seat of the soul [thumos (<i lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θυμός</i>)
the nobler passions]; the liver [is the seat] of desire;”<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> or, as again it
is phrased, “The seat of the soul is unquestionably the heart, even as the
liver is the seat of emotion.”<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Burton has called attention to the fact that among the Arabs, “the
liver and the spleen are both supposed to be ‘congealed blood,’” and
that the Bed´ween of the Hejaz justify their eating of locusts, which
belong to an “unclean” class of animals, and of liver which represents
forbidden blood, by this couplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“We are allowed two carrions, and two bloods,</div>
<div class="verse1">The fish and locust, the liver and the spleen.”<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He has also noted that the American Indian partakes of the liver, as well
as of the heart of a fallen enemy, in order to the assimilating of the enemy’s
life;<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> and he finds many correspondences between the desert dwellers
of America and of Arabia. “The [American] ‘brave,’” he says,
“stamps a red hand upon his mouth to show that he has drunk the
blood of a foe. Of the Utaybah ‘Harami,’ it is similarly related, that
after mortal combat, he tastes the dead man’s gore.”<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Even in modern English, the word “liver” has been thought by
many to represent “life” or “blood.” Thus, in one of our dictionaries
we are told that the word is derived from the Anglo-Saxon and the
Scandinavian verb “to live,” “because [the liver is] of so great importance
to <em>life</em>, or animal vitality.”<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> In another, its derivation is ascribed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
to <em>lopper</em>, and <em>lapper</em>, “to coagulate,” “from its resemblance
to a mass of clotted blood.”<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Among the aborigines of America the prominence given to the blood
and to the heart was as great, and as distinctly marked, as among the
peoples of ancient Egypt, or any other portion of the far East. This
truth has been brought out most fully by the valuable personal researches
of Mr. Frank H. Cushing, of the Smithsonian Institution, into the
mythology and sociology of the Zuñis of New Mexico. From his reports
it would appear that, according to the priests of that people, “all
true fetiches [or, material symbols of spiritual existences] are either
actual petrifactions of the animals they represent, or were such
originally”&mdash;according as the present form of the fetish is natural, or is
mechanically fashioned. These rude stone images of the animals of
prey, “which are of course mere concretions or strangely eroded rock
forms,” are supposed to be the shriveled and distorted remains of beings
which were long ago turned to stone. Within these fetishes the <em>heart</em>
of the original animal still exists; (“his heart still lives, even though his
person be changed to stone”;) and it needs for its sustenance the
blood, or the “life fluid,” of the game which was, from the beginning,
the ordinary prey of that animal. Hence each fetish is pleased to hear
the prayers and to give success to the hunting of its present possessor,
in order to the obtaining of the life fluid which is essential to its nourishing.</p>

<p class="indent">These prey fetishes of the Zuñis belong to the Prey-God Brotherhood,
and when not in use they are guarded by the “Keeper of the Medicine
of the Deer.” Before they are employed in a hunt, there is an assembly
for their worship; and, after ceremonial prayer to them for their
assistance, they are taken out for service by members of the Brotherhood
to which they belong. “The fetich is then placed in a little crescent-shaped
bag of buckskin which the hunter wears suspended over the
left breast (or, heart) by a buckskin thong, which is tied above the right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
shoulder.” When the trail of the animal hunted is discovered by the
hunter, he finds a place where the animal has lain down, and there he
makes an oblation by depositing his offering “in exactly the spot over
which the heart of the animal is supposed to have rested.” Then he
brings out his fetish and with certain ceremonies and invocations he puts
it on the track of the prey.</p>

<p class="indent">“As soon as the animal is dead, he [the hunter] lays open its viscera,
cuts through the diaphragm, and makes an incision in the aorta, or in
the sac which incloses the heart. He then takes out [of its bag] the prey
fetich, breathes on it, and addresses it thus: ... ‘Si! My father,
this day of the blood [literally of the ‘life fluid’] of a game-being, thou
shalt drink, ([shalt] water thyself). With it thou shalt enlarge (add
unto) thy heart.’ He then dips the fetich into the blood which the sac
still contains, continuing meanwhile the prayer, as follows: ...
‘Likewise, I, a “done” being [a living human being], with the blood
[the “life-fluid,” which is] the flesh of a raw being (game animal),
shall enlarge (add unto) my heart.’ Which [prayer] finished, he scoops
up, with his hand, some of the blood and sips it; then tearing forth the
<em>liver</em>, ravenously devours a part of it [as the blood-flesh, or, the blood
which is the flesh], and exclaims, ‘<em>É-lah-kwá!</em>’ (Thanks).” After
all this, he deposits a portion of the clot of blood from within the
heart, commingled with various articles, in a grave digged on the spot
where the animal has died; repeating, as he does this, a prayer which
seems to show his belief that the slain animal still lives in this buried
heart-blood. Again, when the game is at the hunter’s home, the
women “lay on either side of its body, next to the heart, an ear of corn
(significant of renewed life), and say prayers” over it. Finally “the
fetich is returned to the Keeper of the Deer Medicine, with thanksgiving
and a prayer, not unlike that uttered on taking it forth.”<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a></p>

<p class="indent">In these ceremonies, it is evident that the Zuñis, like the Orientals,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
recognize the blood as the life, the heart as the epitome of life, the liver
as a congealed mass of blood, and the transference of blood as the transference
of life. Moreover, there is here a trace of that idea of the revivifying,
by blood-bathing, of a being that had turned into stone; which
is found in the legends of Arabia, and of the Norseland (See page <a href="#Page_119">119</a> f.,
<i>supra</i>). Is there not, indeed, a reference to this world-wide figure of
the living stone, in the Apostle’s suggestion, that those who were counted
as worthless stones by an ignorant world are vivified by the renewing
blood of Christ, and so are shown to be a holy people? “As new born
babes [renewed by the blood of Christ], long for the spiritual milk [the
means of sacred nourishment] which is without guile, that ye may grow
thereby unto salvation; if ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious [if,
indeed, ye have been made alive by the touch of his blood]: unto whom
coming, [unto Him who is] a Living Stone rejected indeed of men, but
with God [who knows the possibilities of that Stone], precious,&mdash;ye
also, as living stones [as new blood-vivified petrifactions], are built up
a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up holy sacrifices,
acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.”<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a></p>

<p class="indent">There is another gleam of this idea of the stones vivified by blood, in
a custom reported from among the Indians of British Columbia, in a
private letter written by a careful observer of Indian habits and ceremonies.
When the Indian girls arrived at the years of womanhood
they were accustomed, there as in many other parts of the world, to
pass through a formal initiation into a new stage of existence. Going
apart by themselves, at some distance from their settlements, they
would lacerate their bodies, in order that blood might flow freely; and,
laying a series of stones in a row, they would walk over them, allowing
their blood to fall upon them. The young woman who could cover the
largest number of stones with her blood, had the fairest prospect in
life, in the line of a woman’s peculiar mission. This certainly would
be a not unnatural thought as an outgrowth of the belief that stones
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
anointed with freely surrendered blood, can be made to have life in
themselves.</p>

<p class="indent">It is much the same in war as in the hunt, among the Zuñis. “As
with the hunter, so with the warrior; the fetich is fed on the life-blood
of the slain.”<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> And here, again, is a link of connection between cannibalism
and religious worship. Another illustration of the preeminence
given to the heart, as the epitome of the very being itself, is the fact
that the animals pictured on the pottery of these people, and of neighboring
peoples, commonly had the rude conventional figure of a heart
represented in its place on each animal; as if to show that the animal
was living, and that it had a living soul.<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a></p>

<p class="indent">At the other side of the world, as it were, in Borneo, there is given
similar preeminence, as among the Zuñis, to the blood as the life, to the
liver as a representative of blood, and to the heart as the epitome of the
life. “The principal sacrifice of the Sakarang Dayaks,” says Mr. St.
John, “is killing a pig and examining its <em>heart</em>, which is supposed to
foretell events with the utmost certainty.” This custom seems to have
grown out of the idea that the heart of any God devoted organism, as
the embodiment of its life is closely linked with the Author of all life;
who is the Disposer of all events. A human heart is naturally deemed
preferable to a pig’s; but the latter is the common substitute for the
former. Yet, “not many years ago,” one of the Sakarang chiefs put
to death a lad “of his own race,” remarking, as he did so: “It has
been our custom heretofore to examine the heart of a pig, but now we
will examine a human one.”<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> The Kayans, again, examine “the
<em>heart</em> and <em>liver</em>,” as preliminary to covenant-making.<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> Among the
Dayaks, the blood of a fowl sacrificed by one who is supposed to be in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
favor with the gods, has peculiar potency when sprinkled upon “the
lintels of the doors.”<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> And a house will be deserted by its Dayak
inhabitants, “if a drop of blood be seen sprinkled on the floor, unless
they can prove whence it came.”<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a></p>

<p class="indent">An incidental connection of this recognition of the blood as the life,
with the primitive rite of blood covenanting, is seen in one form of the
marriage rite among the Dayaks.<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a>&mdash;In the rite of blood-covenanting
itself, as consummated between Mr. St. John and Siñgauding, a cigarette
stained with the blood of the covenanting parties was smoked by them
mutually (See page <a href="#Page_51">51</a>, <i>supra</i>). In the marriage covenant, a cigar and
betel leaf prepared with the areca nut are put first into the mouth of the
bride by the bridegroom, and then into the mouth of the bridegroom
by the bride; while two fowls are waved over their heads by a priest,
and then killed; their blood being “caught in two cups” for examination,
instead of for drinking.<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a></p>

<p class="indent">So, whether it be the heart as the primal fountain of blood, or
the liver as the great receptacle of blood, or the blood itself in its
supposed outflowing from the heart through the liver, that is made
prominent in the rites and teachings of primitive peoples, the root-idea
is still the same,&mdash;that “as to the life of all flesh, the blood
thereof is all one with the life thereof;”<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> and that as a man is in
his blood, so he is in his nature; that his “good blood” or “his
bad blood,” his “hot blood” or his “cold blood,” will be evidenced
in his daily walk; for that which shows out in his outer life is “in
the blood” which is his inner life; and that in order to a change of
his nature there must in some way be a change of his blood. Hence,
the universal outreaching of the race after new blood which is new life.
Hence, the provisions of God for new life through that blood which is
the Life.</p>

<h3><a name="app_3" id="app_3"></a>TRANSMIGRATION OF SOULS.</h3>

<p class="indent">A belief in the transmigration of souls, from man to the lower
animals, and <i>vice versâ</i>, has been found among various peoples, in all
the historic ages. The origin of this belief has been a puzzling question
to rationalistic myth-students. Starting out, as do most of these students,
with the rigid theory that man worked himself slowly upward from
the lowest savagery, without any external revelation, they are confronted
with primitive customs on every side which go to show a popular belief
in soul-transmigration, and which they must try to account for within
the limits of their unproven theory. The result is, that they first presuppose
some conception in the primitive man’s mind of spiritual
things, and then they conveniently refer all confusing facts to that presupposed
conception. “Animism” is one of the pet names for this resolvent
of grave difficulties. And when “Animism” is supplemented by
“Fetishism,” “Zoolatry,” and “Totemism,” the requisite number of
changes is secured for the meeting of any number of perplexing facts in
the religious belief of primitive man everywhere.</p>

<p class="indent">As a matter of simple fact, man’s conception of spiritual existences is
not accounted for by the “scientists.” And the claim that such a conception
was innate in primitive man, or that it was a natural growth in
man’s unaided progress, is at the best but an unproved theory. In the
early part of this century, there were thousands of deaf-mutes in the
United States, who had never been educated by the system which is
now so effective for that class in the community. This gave a rare opportunity
of learning the normal spiritual attainments of unsophisticated
man; of man uninfluenced by external revelation or traditions. Nor
was this opportunity unimproved for a good purpose. When the Rev.
Thomas H. Gallaudet (himself a philosophical scientist) introduced the
system of deaf-mute instruction into this country, he made a careful
examination into the intelligence of all the deaf mutes brought under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
his care, on this point of spiritual conceptions. His declaration was,
that he never found a person who, prior to specific instruction, had any
conception of the nature or the existence of God. A single illustration
of Mr. Gallaudet’s experiences in this line will suffice for the entire
series of them. A young girl of sixteen years of age, or so, who proved
to be of far more than ordinary intelligence and mental capacity, had
been brought up in a New England Christian home. She had been
accustomed to bow her head when grace was said at the daily meals,
to kneel in family prayer, and to attend church regularly, from early
childhood; yet she had no idea of God, no thought of spiritual existences
of any sort whatsoever, until she was instructed in those things,
in the line of her new education.<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> A writer on this subject, who differed
with Mr. Gallaudet in his conclusions from these facts, added: “This
testimony is confirmed by that of all the teachers of the deaf and dumb,
and the fact must be admitted.”<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> Until some human being can be found
with a conception of spiritual existences, without his having received
instruction on that point from those who went before him, the claim&mdash;in
the face of such facts as these&mdash;that primitive man ever obtained his
spiritual knowledge or his spiritual conceptions from within himself
alone, or without an external revelation to him, is an unscientific assumption,
in the investigation of the origin of religions in the world.</p>

<p class="indent">But, with man’s conception of spiritual things, already existing<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a>
(however he came by it), and with the existing belief that the blood is
the life, or the soul, or the nature, of an organism, the idea of the transmigration
of souls as identical with the transference of blood, is a very
natural corollary. The blood being the life, or the soul, of man and of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
beast, if the blood of man passes into the body of a beast, or the blood
of a beast passes into the body of a man, why should it not be inferred
that the soul of the man, or of the beast, transmigrated accordingly?
If the Hindoo, believing that the blood of man is the soul of man,
sees the blood of a man drunk up by a tiger, is it strange that he should
look upon that tiger as having within him the soul of the Hindoo,
which has been thus appropriated? If the South African supposes that,
by his drinking the blood or eating the heart of a lion, he appropriates
the lion’s courage,<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> is it to be wondered at that when he sees a lion licking
the blood and eating the heart of a South African, he should infer
that the lion is thereby the possessor of whatever was distinctive in the
Zulu, or the Hottentot, personality?</p>

<p class="indent">Indeed, as has been already stated, in the body of this work, there is
still a question among physiologists, how far the transference of <em>blood</em>
from one organism to another carries a transmigration of <em>soul</em> (of the
<em>psyche</em>, not of the <em>pneuma</em>).<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> However this may be, the popular
belief in such transmigration is fully accounted for, by the recognized
conviction that the blood is the soul.</p>

<p class="indent">In this view of the case, there is an added force in the Mosaic
prohibition&mdash;repeated as it is in the Apostolic Encyclical&mdash;of the eating,
or drinking, of the blood of the lower animals; with the possibility of
thereby being made a partaker of the lower animal nature. And what
fresh potency is given to Elijah’s prophecy against Ahab and Jezebel,
by this conception of the transference of nature by the transference of
blood! “Thus saith the Lord [to Ahab] Hast thou killed [Hast thou
taken the blood of Naboth?], and also taken possession [of Naboth’s
vineyard]?... Thus saith the Lord, In the place where dogs
licked the blood of Naboth, shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine....
And of Jezebel also spake the Lord, saying, The dogs shall
eat Jezebel by the ramparts of Jezreel.” The blood, the life, the
soul of royalty, shall become a portion of the very life of the prowling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
scavenger dogs of the royal city. And it came to pass accordingly,
to both Ahab and Jezebel.<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a></p>


<h3><a name="app_4" id="app_4"></a>THE BLOOD-RITE IN BURMAH.</h3>

<p class="indent">Mention is made, in the text of this volume,<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> of the fact that the
primitive rite of blood-covenanting is in practice all along the Chinese
border of the Burman Empire. In illustration of this truth, the following
description of the rite and its linkings, is given by the Rev. R. M. Luther,
of Philadelphia, formerly a missionary among the Karens, in Burmah.
This interesting sketch was received, in its present form, at too late a
date for insertion in its place in the text; hence its appearance here.</p>

<p class="indent">“The blood-covenant is well known, and commonly practised among
the Karens of Burmah. There are three methods of making brotherhood,
or truce, between members of one tribe and those of another.</p>

<p class="indent">“The first is the common method of eating together. This, however,
is of but little binding force, being a mere agreement to refrain
from hostilities for a limited time, and the truce thus made is liable to
be broken at the briefest notice.</p>

<p class="indent">“The second method is that of planting a tree. The parties to this
covenant select a young and vigorous sapling, plant it with certain
ceremonies, and covenant with each other to keep peace so long as the
tree lives. A covenant thus made is regarded as of greater force than
that effected or sealed by the first method.</p>

<p class="indent">“The third method is that of the blood-covenant, properly so-called.
In this covenant the chief stands as the representative of the tribe, if it
be a tribal agreement; or, the father as the representative of the family,
if it be a more limited covenant. The ceremonies are public and
solemn. The most important act is, of course, the mingling of the
blood. Blood is drawn from the thigh of each of the covenanting
parties, and mingled together. Then each dips his finger into the blood
and applies it to his lips. In some cases, it is said that the blood is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
actually drunk; but the more common method is that of touching the
lips with the blood-stained finger.<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a></p>

<p class="indent">“This covenant is of the utmost force. It covers not merely an
agreement of peace, or truce, but also a promise of mutual assistance
in peace and in war. It also conveys to the covenanting parties mutual
tribal rites. If they are chiefs, the covenant embraces their entire
tribes. If one is a private individual, his immediate family and direct
descendants are included in the agreement.</p>

<p class="indent">“I never heard of the blood-covenant being broken. I do not
remember to have inquired particularly on this point, because the way
in which the blood-covenant was spoken of, always implied that its rupture
was an unheard-of thing. It is regarded as a perfectly valid excuse
for any amount of reckless devotion, or of unreasoning sacrifice on behalf
of another, for a Karen to say: ‘<em>Thui p’aw th’coh li</em>;’ literally,
‘The blood,&mdash;we have drunk it together.’ An appeal for help on the
basis of the blood-covenant is never disregarded.</p>

<p class="indent">“A few of our missionaries have entered into the blood-covenant
with Karen tribes; though most have been deterred, either from never
having visited the ‘debatable land’ where the strong arm of British
rule does not reach, or else, as in most instances, from a repugnance to
the act by which the covenant is sealed. In one instance, at least,
where a missionary did enter into covenant with one of these tribes,
the agreement has been interpreted as covering not only his children,
but one who was so happy as to marry his daughter. In an enforced
absence of fifteen years from the scene of his early missionary labors
nothing has been at once so touching and so painful to the writer, as the
frequent messages and letters asking ‘When will you come back to
<em>your people</em>?’ Yet, mine is only the inherited right above mentioned.</p>

<p class="indent">“The blood-covenant gives even a foreigner every right which he
would have, if born a member of the tribe. As an instance, the writer
once shot a hawk in a Karen village, just as it was swooping down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
upon a chicken. He was surprised to find, an half-hour afterward,
that his personal attendant, a straightforward Mountain Karen, had
gone through the village and ‘collected’ a fat hen from each house.
When remonstrated with, the mountaineer replied, ‘Why, Teacher, it
is your right,&mdash;that is our custom,&mdash;you are one of us. These people
wouldn’t understand it if I did not ask for a chicken from each house,
when you killed the hawk.’</p>

<p class="indent">“In the wilder Karen regions, it is almost impossible to travel unless
one is in blood-covenant with the chiefs, while on the other hand one
is perfectly safe, if in that covenant. The disregard of this fact has
cost valuable lives. When a stranger enters Karen territory, the chiefs
order the paths closed. This is done by tying the long elephant grass
across the paths. On reaching such a signal, the usual inquiry in the
traveling party is, ‘Who is in blood-covenant with this tribe?’ If one
is found, even among the lowest servants, his covenant covers the
party, on the way, as far as to the principal village or hill fortress.
The party goes into camp, and sends this man on as an ambassador.
Usually, guides are sent back to conduct the party at once to the chief’s
house. If no one is in covenant with the tribe, and the wisp of grass
is broken and the party passes on, the lives of the trespassers are forfeited.
A sudden attack in some defile, or a night surprise, scatters the
party and drives the survivors back the way they came. It is said by
the Karens that Mr. Cooper, the famous English explorer of China and
Thibet, was killed ‘because he had broken the grass.’ A day’s delay
for the blood-covenant would have saved his life, and given him time
to complete his most important labors. The men who killed him would
have been his devoted body-guard, ready and willing to give their lives
in defence of his. If the Karen account of his death is true, it is most
unfortunate that he entered the Karen country from China (where the
blood-covenant does not now prevail), and so was ignorant of the fact
that by so slight a concession to Karen custom he could obtain a guarantee
of safe conduct for at least a thousand miles.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Another account of the blood-covenant rite in Burmah is kindly
furnished to me, by the Rev. Dr. M. H. Bixby, of Providence, Rhode
Island; who was also for some years a missionary among the Karens.
He says:</p>

<p class="indent">“In my first journey over the mountains of Burmah, into Shanland,
toward Western China, I passed through several tribes of wild Karens
among whom the practice of ‘covenanting by blood’ prevailed.</p>

<p class="indent">“‘If you mean what you say,’ said the old chief of the Gecho tribe
to me, referring to my professions of friendship, ‘You will drink truth
with me.’ ‘Well, what is drinking truth?’ I said. In reply, he said:
‘This is our custom. Each chief pierces his arm&mdash;draws blood&mdash;mingles
it in a vessel with whisky, and drinks of it; both promising
to be true and faithful to each other, down to the seventh generation.’</p>

<p class="indent">“After the chiefs had drunk of the mingled blood and whisky, each
one of their followers drunk of it also, and were thereby included in
the covenant of friendship.</p>

<p class="indent">“A company of Shans laid a plot to kill me and my company in
Shanland, for the purpose of plunder. They entered into covenant
with each other by drinking the blood of their leader mingled with
whisky, or a kind of beer made from rice.</p>

<p class="indent">“Those wild mountain tribes have strange traditions which indicate
that they once had the Old Testament Scriptures, although now they
have no written language. Some of the Karen tribes have a written
language, given them by the missionaries.</p>

<p class="indent">“The covenant, also, exists in modified forms, in which the blood is
omitted.”</p>


<h3><a name="app_5" id="app_5"></a>BLOOD-STAINED TREE OF THE COVENANT.</h3>

<p class="indent">In various parts of the East, a <em>tree</em> is given prominence in the rite
of blood-covenanting. In Burmah, as above shown, one mode of covenanting
is by the mutual planting of a tree.<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> In Timor, a newly planted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
fig-tree is made to bear a portion of the blood of the covenant, and to
remain as a witness to the sacred rite itself.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> In one portion of Central
Africa, a forked palm branch is held by the two parties, at their entering
into blood-friendship;<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> and, in another region, the ashes of a burned
tree and the blood of the covenanting brothers are brought into combination,
in the use of a knotted palm branch which the brothers together
hold.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> And, again, in Canaan, in the days of Abraham, the planting of
a tree was an element in covenant making; as shown in the narrative
of the covenant which Abraham cut with Abimelech, at Beer-sheba.<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a></p>

<p class="indent">It may, indeed, be fair to suppose that the trees at Hebron, which
marked the dwelling-place of Abraham were covenant-trees, witnessing
the covenant between Abraham and the three Amorite chiefs; and that
therefore they have prominence in the sacred story. “Now he [Abram]
dwelt by [or, in: Hebrew, <i>beëlonay</i> (<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1465;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;</span>)] the [four] oaks [or,
terebinths], of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of
Aner; and these [three it was who] were confederate [literally, were
masters of the covenant] with [the fourth one] Abram.”<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> This rendering
certainly gives a reason for the prominent mention of the trees at
Hebron, in conjunction with Abram’s covenant with Amorite chieftains;
and it accords with Oriental customs of former days, and until to-day.
So, also, it would seem that the tree which witnessed<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> the confirmation,
or the recognition, of the covenant between another Abimelech, and
the men of Shechem and the men of Beth-millo, by the pillar (the
symbol of Baal-bereeth)<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> in Shechem,<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> was a covenant-tree, after the
Oriental custom in sacred covenanting.</p>

<p class="indent">There is apparently a trace of the blood-covenanting and tree-planting
rite of primitive times, in the blood-stained “Fiery Cross” of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
Scottish Highlands, with its correspondent Arabian symbol of tribal
covenant-duties in the hour of battle. <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Von Wrede</span>, describing his travels
in the south-eastern part of Arabia, tells of the use of this symbol as he
saw it employed, as preliminary to a tribal warfare. A war-council had
decided on conflict. Then, “the fire which had burned in the midst
of the circle was newly kindled with a great heap of wood, and the
up-leaping flames were greeted with loud rejoicing. The green branch
of a nŭbk tree [sometimes called the ‘lote-tree,’ and again known as
the ‘dôm,’ although it is not the dôm palm]<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> was then brought, and
also a sheep, whose feet were at once tied by the oldest shaykh. After
these preparations, the latter seized the branch, spoke a prayer over it,
and committed it to the flames. As soon as every trace of green had
disappeared, he snatched it from the fire, again said a short prayer, and
cut with his <i>jembeeyeh</i> [his short sword] the throat of the sheep, with
whose blood the yet burning branch was quenched. He then tore a
number of little twigs from the burnt branch, and gave them to as
many Bed´ween, who hastened off with them in various directions.
The black bloody branch was then planted in the earth.... The
little twigs, which the shaykh cut off and gave to the Bed´ween, serve
as alarm signals, with which the messengers hasten from valley to
valley, calling the sons of the tribe to the impending war [by this
blood-stained symbol of the sacred covenant which binds them in
brotherhood]. None dare remain behind, without loss of honor, when
the chosen [covenant] sign appears at his encampment, and the voice of
its bearer calls to the war.... At the conclusion of the war [thus
inaugurated], the shaykhs of the propitiated tribe return the branches to
the fire, and let them burn to ashes.”<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a></p>

<p class="indent">How strikingly this parallels the use and the symbolism of the Fiery
Cross, in the Scottish Highlands, as portrayed in The Lady of the Lake.

<p class="indent">“At sight of the Fiery Cross,” says Scott, “every man, from sixteen
years old to sixty, capable of bearing arms, was obliged instantly to
repair, in his best arms and accoutrements, to the place of rendezvous....
During the civil war of 1745-6, the Fiery Cross often made its
circuit; and upon one occasion it passed through the whole district of
Breadalbane, a tract of thirty-two miles, in three hours.”<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a></p>


<h3><a name="app_6" id="app_6"></a>BLOOD-DRINKING.</h3>

<p class="indent">Another item of evidence that the blood-covenant in its primitive
form was a well-known rite in primitive Europe, is a citation by Athenæus
from Poseidonios to this effect: “Concerning the Germans, Poseidonios
says, that they, embracing each other in their banquets, open the
veins upon their foreheads,<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> and mixing the flowing blood with their drink,
they present it to each other; esteeming it the farthest attainment of friendship,
to taste each other’s blood.”<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> As Poseidonios was earlier than our
Christian era, this testimony shows that the custom with our ancestors was
in no sense an outgrowth, nor yet a perversion, of Christian practices.</p>

<p class="indent">In Moore’s Lalla Rookh, the young maiden, Zelica, being induced
by Mokanna, the Veiled Prophet of Khorassan, to accompany him to
the charnel-house, pledged herself to him, body and soul, in a draught
of blood.</p>

<div class="verse1">And pledged in silence such a fearful draught,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>It was after this, that he reminded her of the binding force of this blood-covenant:</p>

<div class="verse">“That cup&mdash;thou shudderest, Lady&mdash;was it sweet?</div>

<div class="verse1">Hath bound thee&mdash;aye&mdash;body and soul all mine.”</div>

<p>And her bitter memory of that covenant-scene, in the presence of the

<div class="verse">“The dead stood round us, while I spoke that vow,</div>

<div class="verse1">’Twas burning blood&mdash;I feel it in my soul!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Although this is Western poetry, it had a basis of careful Oriental study
in its preparation; and the blood-draught of the covenant is known to
Persian story and tradition.</p>

<p class="indent">One of the indications of the world-wide belief in the custom of
covenanting, and again of life seeking, by blood-drinking, is the fact
that both Jews and Christians have often been falsely charged with
drinking the blood of little children, at their religious feasts. This was
one of the frequent accusations against the early Christians (See Justin
Martyr’s <cite>Apol.</cite>, I., 26; Tertullian’s <cite>Apol.</cite>, VIII., IX.) And it has been
repeated against the Jews, from the days of Apion down to the present
decade. Such a baseless charge could not have gained credence, but
for the traditional understanding that men were wont to pledge each
other to a close covenant by mutual blood-drinking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="app_7" id="app_7"></a>COVENANT-CUTTING.</h3>

<p class="indent">It is worthy of note that when the Lord enters into covenant with
Abraham by means of a prescribed sacrifice (Gen. 15 : 7-18), it is said
that the Lord “cut a covenant with Abram”; but when the Lord calls
on Abraham to cut a covenant of blood-friendship, by the rite of circumcision
(Gen. 17 : 1-12), the Lord says, for himself, “I will make
[or I will fix] my covenant between me and thee.” In the one case,
the Hebrew word is <i>karath</i> (<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1514;</span>) “to cut”; in the other, it is <i>nathan</i>
(<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1503;</span>) “to give,” or “to fix.” This change goes to show that the idea of
cutting a covenant includes the act of a cutting&mdash;of a cutting of one’s
person or the cutting of the substitute victim&mdash;as an integral part of the
covenant itself; that a covenant may be made, or fixed, without a cutting,
but that the term “cutting” involves the act of cutting.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus, again, in Jeremiah 34 : 18, there is a two-fold reference to
covenant-cutting; where the Lord reproaches his people for their faithlessness
to their covenant. “And I will give [to destruction] the men
that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the
words of the covenant which they made [literally, ‘cut’] before me [in
my sight] when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts
thereof.” In this instance, there is in the Hebrew, a pun, as it were, to
give added force to the accusation and reproach. The same word <i>’abhar</i>
(<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;</span>) means both “to transgress” and “to pass over” [or, “between”],
so that, freely rendered, the charge here made, is, that they went through
the covenant when they had gone through the calf; which is another way
of saying that they cut their duty when they claimed to cut a covenant.</p>

<p class="indent">The correspondence of cutting the victim of sacrifice, and of cutting
into the flesh of the covenanting parties, in the ceremony of making
blood-brotherhood, or blood-friendship, is well-illustrated in the interchanging
of these methods in the primitive customs of Borneo.<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> The
pig is the more commonly prized victim of sacrifice in Borneo. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
seems, indeed, to be there valued only next after a human victim. In
some cases, blood-brotherhood is made, in Borneo, by “imbibing each
other’s blood.” In other cases, “a pig is brought and placed between
the two [friends] who are to be joined in brotherhood. A chief addresses
an invocation to the gods, and marks with a lighted brand<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> the
pig’s shoulder. The beast is then killed, and after an exchange of
jackets,<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> a sword is thrust into the wound, and the two [friends] are
marked with the blood of the pig.” On one occasion, when two hostile
tribes came together to make a formal covenant of brotherhood,
“the ceremony of killing a pig for each tribe” was the central feature
of the compact; as in the case of two Kayans becoming one by interchanging
their own blood, actually or by a substitute pig. And it is
said of the tribal act of cutting the covenant by cutting the pig, that
“it is thought more fortunate if the animal be severed in two by
one stroke of the parang (half sword, half chopper).” In another
instance, where two tribes entered into a covenant, “a pig was placed
between the representatives of [the] two tribes; who, after calling
down the vengeance of the spirits on those who broke the treaty,
plunged their spears into the animal [‘cutting a covenant’ in that
way], and then exchanged weapons.<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> Drawing their krises, they each
bit the blade of the other [as if ‘drinking the covenant’],<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> and so completed
the affair.” So, again, “if two men who have been at deadly
feud, meet in a house [where the obligations of hospitality restrain
them], they refuse to cast their eyes upon each other till a fowl has
been killed, and the blood sprinkled over them.”</p>

<p class="indent">In every case, it is the <em>blood</em> that seals the mutual covenant, and the
“cutting of the covenant” is that cutting which secures the covenanting,
or the inter-uniting, blood. The cutting may be in the flesh of the
covenanting parties; or, again it may be in the flesh of the substitute
victim which is sacrificed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="app_8" id="app_8"></a>BLOOD-BATHING.</h3>

<p class="indent">In the Midrash Rabboth (<cite>Shemoth</cite>, Beth, 92, col. 2.) there is this
comment by the Rabbis, on Exodus 2 : 23: “‘And the king of Egypt
died.’ He was smitten with leprosy.... ‘And the children of
Israel sighed.’ Wherefore did they sigh? Because the magicians of
Egypt said: ‘There is no healing for thee save by the slaying of the
little children of the Israelites. Slay them in the morning, and slay them
in the evening; and bathe in their blood twice a day.’ As soon as the
children of Israel heard the cruel decree, they poured forth great sighings
and wailings.” That comment gives a new point, in the rabbinical
mind, to the first plague, whereby the waters of the Nile, in which
royalty bathed (Exod. 2 : 5), were turned into blood, because of the
bondage of the children of Israel.</p>

<p class="indent">A survival of the blood-baths of ancient Egypt, as a means of re-vivifying
the death-smitten, would seem to exist in the medical practices of
the Bechuana tribes of Africa; as so many of the customs of ancient
Egypt still survive among the African races (See page <a href="#Page_15">15</a>, <i>supra</i>). Thus,
Moffat reports (<cite>Missionary Labours</cite>, p. 277) a method employed by
native physicians, of killing a goat “over the sick person, allowing the
blood to run down the body.”</p>


<h3><a name="app_9" id="app_9"></a>BLOOD-RANSOMING.</h3>

<p class="indent">Among other Bible indications that the custom of balancing, or
canceling, a blood account by a payment in money, was well known in
ancient Palestine, appears the record of David’s conference with the
Gibeonites, concerning their claim for blood against the house of Saul,
in 2 Samuel 21 : 1-9. When it was found that the famine in Israel
was because of Saul’s having taken blood&mdash;or life&mdash;unjustly from the
Gibeonites, David essayed to balance that unsettled account. “And the
Gibeonites said unto him, It is no matter of silver or gold between us
and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
Israel;” which was equivalent to saying: “Money for blood we will
not take. Blood for blood we have no power to obtain.” Then said
David, “What ye shall say, that will I do for you.” At this, the
Gibeonites demanded, and obtained, the lives of the seven sons of Saul.
The blood account must be balanced. In this case, as by the Mosaic
law, it could only be by life for life.</p>

<p class="indent">In some parts of Arabia, if a Muhammadan slays a person of another
religion, the relatives of the latter are not allowed to insist on blood
for blood, but must accept an equivalent in money. The claim for the
spilled blood is recognized, but a Muhammadan’s blood is too precious
for its payment. (See Wellsted’s <cite>Travels in Arabia</cite>, I., 19.)</p>

<p class="indent">It is much the same in the far West as in the far East, as to this canceling
of a blood-debt by blood or by other gifts. Parkman (<cite>Jesuits
in No. Am.</cite>, pp. lxi.-lxiii.; 354-360) says of the custom among the
Hurons and the Iroquois, that in case of bloodshed the chief effort of
all concerned was to effect a settlement by contributions to the amount
of the regular tariff rates of a human life.</p>

<p class="indent">Another indication that the mission of the goel was to cancel the loss of
a life rather than to avenge it, is found in the primitive customs of the
New World. “Even in so rude a tribe as the Brazilian Topanazes,” the
Farrer (citing <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Eschwege</span>, in <cite>Prim. Man. and Cust.</cite>, p. 164), “a murderer
of a fellow tribesman would be conducted by his relations to those of the
deceased, to be by them forthwith strangled and buried [with his forfeited
blood in him], in satisfaction of their rights; the two families eating
together for several days after the event as though for the purpose of
[or, as in evidence of] reconciliation,”&mdash;not of satisfied revenge.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet more convincing than all, in the line of such proofs that it is restitution,
and not vengeance, that is sought by the pursuit of blood in the
mission of the goel, is the fact that in various countries, when a man has
died a natural death, it is the custom to seek blood, or life, from those
immediately about him; as if to restore, or to equalize, the family loss.
Thus, in New South Wales, “when any one of the tribe dies a natural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
death, it is usual to avenge [not to avenge, but to meet] the loss of the
deceased by taking blood from one or other of his friends,” and it is said
that death sometimes results from this endeavor (Angas’s <cite>Sav. Life</cite>, II.,
227). In this fact, there is added light on the almost universal custom
of blood-giving to, or over, the dead. (See, <i>e. g.</i> Ellis’s <cite>Land
of Fetish</cite>, pp. 59, 64; Stanley’s <cite>The Congo</cite>, II., 180-182; Angas’s
<cite>Sav. Life</cite>, I., 98, 331; II., 84, 89 f.; Ellis’s <cite>Polyn. Res.</cite>,
I., 527-529; Dodge’s <cite>Our Wild Indians</cite>, p. 172 f.; <cite>First An. Rep.
of Bureau of Ethn.</cite>, pp. 109, 112, 159 f., 164, 183, 190.)</p>


<h3><a name="app_10" id="app_10"></a>THE COVENANT-REMINDER.</h3>

<p class="indent">It has already been shown, that the blood-stained record of the covenant
of blood, shielded in a leathern case, is proudly worn as an
armlet or as a necklace, by the Oriental who has been fortunate enough
to become a sharer in such a covenant; and that there is reason for
believing that there are traces of this custom, in the necklaces, the
armlets, the rings, and the frontlets, which have been worn as the
tokens of a sacred covenant, in well-nigh all lands, from the earliest
days of Chaldea and Egypt down to the present time. There is a confirmation
of this idea in the primitive customs of the North American
Indians, which ought not to be overlooked.</p>

<p class="indent">The distinctive method by which these Indians were accustomed to
confirm and signalize a formal covenant, or a treaty, was the exchange
of belts of wampum; and that these wampum belts were not merely
conventional gifts, but were actual records, tokens, and reminders, of
the covenant itself, there is abundant evidence. In a careful paper on the
“Art in Shell of the Ancient Americans,” in one of the reports of the
Bureau of Ethnology, of the Smithsonian Institution, the writer<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> says:
“One of the most remarkable customs practiced by the Americans is
found in the mnemonic use of wampum.... It does not seem
probable ... that a custom so unique and so widespread could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
have grown up within the historic period, nor is it probable that a
practice foreign to the genius of tradition-loving races could have become
so well established and so dear to their hearts in a few generations....
The mnemonic use of wampum is one, which, I
imagine, might readily develop from the practice of gift giving and the
exchange of tokens of friendship, such mementoes being preserved for
future reference as reminders of promises of assistance or protection....
The wampum records of the Iroquois [and the same is found
to be true in many other tribes] were generally in the form of belts [as
an encircling and binding token of a covenant], the beads being strung
or woven into patterns formed by the use of different colors.” Illustrations,
by the score, of this mnemonic use of the covenant-confirming
belts, or “necklaces,”<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> as they are sometimes called, are given, or are
referred to, in this interesting article.</p>

<p class="indent">In the narrative of a council held by the “Five Nations,” at Onondaga,
nearly two hundred years ago, a Seneca sachem is said to have
presented a proposed treaty between the Wagunhas and the Senecas,
with the words: “We come to join the two bodies into one”; and he
evidenced his good faith in this endeavor, by the presentation of the
mnemonic belts of wampum. “The belts were accepted by the Five
Nations, and their acceptance was a ratification of the treaty.”<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lafitau</span>,
writing of the Canadian Indians, in the early years of the eighteenth
century, says: “They do not believe that any transaction can be concluded
without these belts;” and he mentions, that according to Indian
custom these belts were to be exchanged in covenant making; “that is
to say, for one belt [received] one must give another [belt].”<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> And a
historian of the Moravian Missions says: “Everything of moment transacted
at solemn councils, either between the Indians themselves, or with
Europeans, is ratified and made valid by strings and belts of wampum.”<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
“The strings,” according to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lafitau</span>, “are used for affairs of
little consequence, or as a preparation for other more considerable presents”;
but the binding “belts” were as the bond of the covenant itself.</p>

<p class="indent">These covenant belts often bore, interwoven with different colored
wampum beads, symbolic figures, such as two hands clasped in friendship,
or two figures with hands joined. As the belts commonly signalized
tribal covenants, they were not worn by a single individual; but
were sacredly guarded in some tribal depository; yet their form and
their designation indicate the origin of their idea.</p>

<p class="indent">There is still preserved, in the Historical Society of Pennsylvania,
the wampum belt which is supposed to have sealed the treaty of peace
and friendship between William Penn and the Indians. It contains
two figures, wrought in dark colored beads, representing “an Indian
grasping with the hand of friendship the hand of a man evidently
intended to be represented in the European costume, wearing a hat.”<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Still more explicit in its symbolism, is the royal belt of the primitive
kings of Tahiti. Throughout Polynesia, red feathers, which had been
inclosed in a hollow image of a god, were considered not only as emblematic
of the deities, but as actually representing them in their personality
(Ellis’s <cite>Polyn. Res.</cite>, I., 79, 211, 314, 316; II., 204; <cite>Tour thro’
Hawaii</cite>, p. 121). “The inauguration ceremony [of the Tahitian king],
answering to coronation among other nations, consisted in girding the
king with the <i>maro ura</i>, or sacred girdle of red feathers; which not
only raised him to the highest earthly station, but <em>identified him with
their gods</em> [as by oneness of blood]. The <i>maro</i>, or girdle, was made
with the beaten fibres of the ava; with these a number of <i>ura</i>, red
feathers, taken from the images of their deities [where they had, seemingly,
represented the blood, or the life, of the image], were interwoven;
... the feathers [as the blood] being supposed to retain all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
dreadful attributes of vengeance which the idols possessed, and with
which it was designed to endow the king.” In lieu of the king’s own
blood, in this symbolic ceremony of inter-union, a human victim was
sacrificed, for the “fastening on of the sacred maro.” “Sometimes a
human victim was offered for every fresh piece added to the girdle [blood
for blood, between the king and the god]; ... and the girdle
was considered as consecrated by the blood of those victims.” The chief
priest of the god Oro formally invested the king with this “sacred girdle,
which, the [blood-representing] feathers from the idol being interwoven
in it, was supposed to impart to the king a power equal to that possessed
by Oro.” After this, the king was supposed to be a sharer of the divine
nature of Oro, with whom he had entered into a covenant of blood-union
(Ellis’s <cite>Polyn. Res.</cite>, II., 354-360).</p>

<p class="indent">Thus it seems that a band, as a bond, of a sacred covenant is treasured
reverently in the New World; as a similar token, of one kind, or another,
was treasured, for the same reason, in the Old World. Yet, in
the face of such facts as these, one of the notable rationalistic theological
writers on Old Testament manners and customs, in the latest edition of
the Encyclopædia Britannica, coolly ascribes the idea of the Jewish phylacteries
to the superstitious idea of a pagan “amulet.” He might indeed,
with good reason, have ascribed the idea of the pagan amulet itself
to a perversion of that common primitive idea of the binding bond of a
sacred covenant, which shows itself in the blood-friendship record of
Syria, in the red covenant-cord of China and India, in the divine-human
covenant token of ancient Egypt, in the red-feather belt of divine-royal
union, in the Pacific Islands, in the wampum belt of America, and in
the evolved wedding-covenant ring, or amulet, of a large portion of the
civilized world. But that would hardly have been in accordance with
the fashionable method of the modern rationalistic theologian; which is,
to fix on some later heathenish perversion of a primitive sacred rite, and
then to ascribe the origin of all the normal uses of that primitive rite, to
its own later perversions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Yet another indication that the binding circlet of the covenant-token
stands, among primitive peoples, as also among cultivated ones, as the
representative, or proof, of this very covenant itself, is found in a method
of divorce prevailing among the Balau Dayaks, of Borneo. It has
already been shown (page <a href="#Page_73">73</a>, <i>supra</i>) that a ring of blood is a binding
symbol in the marriage covenant in some parts of Borneo. It seems, also,
that when a divorce has been agreed on by a Balau couple, “it is necessary
for the offended husband to send a ring to his wife, before the
marriage can be considered as finally dissolved; without which, should
they marry again, they would be liable to be punished for infidelity.”<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>
This practice seems to have grown out of the old custom already
referred to (page <a href="#Page_73">73</a> f.), of the bride giving to the bridegroom a blood-representing
ring in the marriage cup. Until that symbolic ring is returned
to her by the bridegroom, it remains as the proof of her covenant
with him.</p>

<p class="indent">This connection of the encircling ring with the heart’s blood, is of very
ancient origin, and of general, if not of universal, application. Wilkinson
(<cite>Anc. Egypt.</cite>, III., 420) cites Macrobius as saying, that “those Egyptian
priests who were called prophets, when engaged in the temple near the
altars of the gods, moistened [anointed] the ring-finger of the left hand
(which was that next to the smallest) with various sweet ointments, in
the belief that a certain nerve communicated with it from the heart.”
He also says, that among the Egyptian women, many finger rings were
worn, and that “the left was considered the hand peculiarly privileged
to wear these ornaments; and it is remarkable that its third finger [next
to the little finger] was considered by them, as by us, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i> the
ring finger; though there is no evidence [to his knowledge] of its having
been so honored at the marriage ceremony.” Birch adds (<i>Ibid.</i>, II.,
340), that “it is very difficult to distinguish between the ring worn for
mere ornament, and the signet [standing for the wearer’s very life] employed
to seal [and to sign] epistles and other things.” The evidence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
is, in fact, ample, that the ring, in ancient Egypt, as elsewhere, was not
a mere ornament, nor yet a superstitious amulet, but represented one’s
heart, or one’s life, as a symbol and pledge of personal fidelity.</p>

<p class="indent">In South Australia, the rite of circumcision is one of the steps by
which a lad enters into the sphere of manhood. This involves his covenanting
with his new god-father, and with his new fellows in the sphere
of his entering. In this ceremony, the very ring of flesh itself is placed
“on the third finger of the boy’s left hand” (Angas’s <cite>Sav. Life</cite>, I., 99).
What stronger proof than this could be given, that the finger-ring is a
vestige of the primitive blood-covenant token?</p>

<p class="indent">An instance of the use of a large ring, or bracelet, encircling the two
hands of persons joining in the marriage covenant, is reported to me from
the North of Ireland, in the present century. It was in the county Donegal.
The Roman Catholic priest was a French exile. In marrying the
people of the poorer class, who could not afford to purchase a ring, he
“would take the large ring from his old-fashioned double-cased watch,
and hold it on the hands, or the thumbs, of the contracting parties,
while he blessed their union.”</p>

<p class="indent">Yet another illustration of the universal symbolism of the ring, as a
token of sacred covenant, is its common use as a pledge of friendship,
even unto death. The ring given by Queen Elizabeth to the unfortunate
Earl of Essex, is an instance in point. Had that covenant-token reached
her, her covenant promises would have been redeemed.</p>

<p class="indent">There is an old Scottish ballad, “Hynd Horn,”&mdash;perhaps having a
common origin with the Bohemian lay on which Scott based The
Noble Moringer,<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a>&mdash;which brings out the idea of a covenant-ring having
the power to indicate to its wearer the fidelity of its giver; corresponding
with the popular belief to that effect, suggested by Bacon.<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> Hynd
Horn has won the heart of the king’s daughter, and the king sends
him over the sea, as a means of breaking up the match. As he sets
out Hynd Horn carries with him a symbol of his lady-love’s troth.</p>

<p class="indent">At a Brahman wedding, in India, described by Miss H. G. Brittan (in
“The Missionary Link,” for October, 1864; cited in <cite>Women of the
Orient</cite>, pp. 176-179) a silver dish, filled with water, (probably with water
colored with saffron, or with turmeric, according to the common custom in
India,) “also containing a very handsome ruby ring, and a thin iron bracelet,”
was set before the father of the bride, during the marriage ceremony.
At the covenanting of the young couple, “the ring was given to the
groom; the bracelet to the bride; then some of the [blood-colored?]
water was sprinkled on them (See page <a href="#Page_194">194</a>, <i>supra</i>), and some flowers
[were] thrown at them.” Here seem to be combined, the symbolisms
of the ring, the bracelet, and the blood, in a sacred covenanting.</p>


<h3><a name="app_11" id="app_11"></a>HINTS OF BLOOD-UNION.</h3>

<p class="indent">From the very fact that so little attention has been given to the primitive
rite of blood-covenanting, in the studies of modern scholars, there
is reason for supposing that the rite itself has very often been unnoticed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
by travelers and missionaries in regions where it was practiced almost
under their eyes. Indeed, there is proof of this to be obtained, by
comparing the facts recorded in this volume with the writings of visitors
to the lands here reported from. Hence, it is fair to infer, that more or
less of the brotherhoods or friendships noted among primitive peoples,
without any description of the methods of their consummating, are
either directly based on the rite of blood-covenanting, or are outgrowths
and variations of that rite; as, for example, in Borneo, blood-tasting is
sometimes deemed essential to the rite, and again it is omitted. It may
be well, therefore, to look at some of the hints of blood-union among
primitive peoples, in relationships and in customs where not all the facts
and processes involved, are known to us.</p>

<p class="indent">Peculiarly is it true, that wherever we find the idea of an absolute
merging of two natures into one, or of an inter-union or an inter-changing
of two personalities in loving relation, there is reason for suspecting
a connection with the primitive rite of inter-union through a common
blood flow. And there are illustrations of this idea in the Old World
and in the New, all along the ages.</p>

<p class="indent">It has already been mentioned (page <a href="#Page_109">109</a>, <i>supra</i>) that, in India, the
possibility of an inter-union of two natures, and of their inter-merging
into one, is recognized in the statement that “the heart of Vishnu is
Sivâ, and the heart of Sivâ is Vishnu”; and it is a well-known philosophical
fact that man must have an actual basis of human experience
for the symbolic language with which he illustrates the nature and
characteristics of Deity.</p>

<p class="indent">In the most ancient portion of the ancient Egyptian Book of the
Dead,<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> there is a description of the inter-union of Osiris and Rā, not
unlike that above quoted concerning Sivâ and Vishnoo. It says, that
“Osiris came to Tattu (Mendes) and found the soul of Rā there; each
embraced the other, and become as one soul in two souls”<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a>&mdash;as one
life in two lives; or, as it would be phrased concerning two human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
beings united in blood-friendship, “one soul in two bodies”; a common
life in two personalities. Again it is said in an Egyptian sacred text,
“Rā is the soul of Osiris, and Osiris is the soul of Rā.”<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a></p>

<p class="indent">An exchange of names, as if in exchange of personalities, in connection
with a covenant of friendship, is a custom in widely diverse
countries; and this custom seems to have grown out of the idea
of an inter-union of natures by an inter-union of blood; even if it
be not actually an accompaniment of that rite in every instance. It
is common in the Society Islands,<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> as an element in the adoption of
a “tayo,” or a personal friend and companion (See page <a href="#Page_56">56</a>, <i>supra</i>).
It is to be found in various South Sea islands, and on the American
continent.</p>

<p class="indent">Among the Araucanians, of South America, the custom of making
brothers, or brother-friends, is called <i>Lacu</i>. It includes the killing of a
lamb and dividing it&mdash;“cutting” it&mdash;between the two covenanting
parties; and each party must eat his half of the lamb&mdash;either by himself
or by such assistance as he chooses to call in. None of it must be
left uneaten. Gifts also pass between the parties; and the two friends
exchange names. “The giving [the exchanging] of a name [with this
people] establishes between the namesakes a species of relationship
which is considered almost as sacred as that of blood, and obliges them
to render to each other certain services, and that consideration which
naturally belongs to relatives.”<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a></p>

<p class="indent">It is related of Tolo, a chief of the Shastika Indians, on the Pacific
coast, that when he made a treaty with Col. McKee, an American
soldier, in 1852, for the cession of certain tribal rights, he was anxious
for some ceremony of brotherhood, that should give binding sacredness
to the mutual covenant. After some parleying, he proposed the formal
exchange of names, and this was agreed to. Thenceforward he desired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
to be known as “McKee.” The American colonel was now “Tolo.”
But after a while the Indian found that, as in too many other instances,
the terms of the treaty were not adhered to by the authorities making
it. Then he discarded his new name, “McKee,” and refused to resume
his former name, “Tolo.” He would not answer to either, and
to the day of his death he insisted that his name, his identity, was
“lost.”<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a>&mdash;There is a profound sentiment underneath such a course, and
such a custom, as that.</p>

<p class="indent">So fully is the identity of one’s name and one’s life recognized by
primitive peoples, that to call on the name of a dead person is generally
supposed to summon the spirit of that person to the caller’s service.
Hence, among the American Indians, if one calls the dead by name, he
must answer to the dead man’s goel. He must surrender his own blood,
or pay blood-money, in restitution of the life&mdash;of the dead&mdash;taken by
him. (<cite>First An. Rep. of Bureau of Ethnol.</cite>, p. 200.)</p>

<p class="indent">Even Herbert Spencer sees the correspondence of the blood-covenant
and the exchange of names. He says: “By absorbing each other’s
blood, men are supposed to establish actual community of nature.
Similarly with the ceremony of exchanging names.... This,
which is a widely-diffused practice, arises from the belief that the name
is vitally connected with its owner.... To exchange names,
therefore, is to establish some participation in one another’s being.”<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a>
Hence, as we may suppose, came the well-nigh universal Oriental practice
of inter-weaving the name of one’s Deity with one’s name, as a
symbolic evidence of one’s covenant-union with the Deity. The blood-covenant,
or the blood-union, idea is at the bottom of this.</p>

<p class="indent">Another custom, having a peculiar bearing upon this thought of a
new name, or a new identity, through new blood, is the rite of initiation
into manhood, by the native Australians. During childhood the
Australian boys are under the care of their mothers, and they bear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
names which designate the place and circumstances of their birth. But
when the time comes for them to put away childish things,<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> they are
subjected to a series of severe and painful tests, to prove their powers
of physical and mental endurance, preparatory to their reception of a
new name, as indicative of a new life. A rite resembling circumcision
is one step in their progress. During these ceremonies, there is selected
for each lad a sponsor (or godfather) who is a representative of
that higher life into which the lad seeks an entrance. One of the latest
steps in the long series of ceremonies, is the choosing and conferring,
by the sponsor, of the lad’s new name, which he is to retain thenceforward
during his life. With a stone-knife, the sponsor opens a vein
in his own arm, and causes the lad to drink his warm-flowing blood.
After this, the lad drops forward on his hands and knees, and the
sponsor’s blood is permitted to form a pool on his back, and to coagulate
there. Then the sponsor cuts, with his stone-knife, broad gashes
in the lad’s back, and pulls open the gaping wounds with the fingers.
The scars of these gashes remain as permanent signs of the covenant
ceremony.<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> And encircling tokens of the covenant<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> are bound around
the neck, each arm, and the waist, of the young man; who is now
reckoned a new creature<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> in the life represented by that godfather, who
has given him his new name, and has imparted to him of his blood.<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a></p>

<p class="indent">That the transfusion of blood in this ceremony is the making of a
covenant between the youth and his sponsor, and not the giving him
blood in vivification, is indicated in another form of the same rite of
manhood-initiation, as practised in New South Wales. There, the youth is
seated upon the shoulders of his sponsor; while one of his teeth is knocked
out. The blood that flows from the boy’s lacerated gum in this ceremony
is not wiped away, but is suffered to run down upon his breast, and thence
upon the head of his sponsor, whose name he takes. This blood, which
secures, by its absorption, a common life between the two, who have now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
a common name, is permitted to dry upon the head of the man and upon
the breast of the boy, and to remain there untouched for several days.</p>

<p class="indent">In this New South Wales ceremonial, there is another feature, which
seems to suggest that remarkable connection of life with a stone, which
has been already referred to (page <a href="#Page_307">307</a>, <i>supra</i>); and yet again to suggest
the giving of a new name as the token of a new life. A white stone, or
a quartz crystal, called <i>mundie</i>, is given to each novitiate in manhood,
at the time he receives his new name. This stone is counted a gift
from deity, and is held peculiarly sacred. A test of the young man’s
moral stamina is made by the old men’s trying, by all sorts of persuasion,
to induce him to surrender this possession, when first he has received it.
This accompaniment of a new name “is worn concealed in the hair, tied
up in a packet, and is never shown to the women, who are forbidden to
look at it under pain of death.” The youths receiving and retaining
these white stones, with their new names, are termed “<em>Kebarrah</em>,
from <i>keba</i>, a rock, or stone.” (Angas’s <cite>Savage Life</cite>, II., 221.) That
the idea of a sacred covenant, a covenant of brotherhood and friendship,
is underneath these ceremonies, is indicated by the fact, that when the
rites of Kebarrah are celebrated, even “hostile tribes meet in peace; all
animosity between them being laid aside during the performance of these
ceremonies.” “To him that overcometh, [saith the Spirit,] ... I will
give him a white stone, and upon the stone a new name written, which no
one knoweth but he that receiveth it” (Rev. 2 : 17). The Rabbis recommend
the giving secretly of a new name, as a means of new life, to him
who is in danger of dying. (See <cite>Seph. Hakhkhay.</cite>, p. 37 f. and note.)</p>

<p class="indent">Again, in a form of marriage ceremony in Tahiti, there is a hint of
this universal idea of inter-union by blood. An observer of this ceremony,
in describing it says: “The female relatives cut their faces
and brows<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> with the instrument set with shark’s teeth,<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> received the
flowing blood on a piece of native cloth, and deposited the cloth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
sprinkled with the mingled blood of <em>the mothers</em> of the married pair, at
the feet of the bride. By the latter parts of the ceremony, any inferiority
of rank that might have existed was removed, and they were [now]
considered as equal. The two families, also, to which they respectively
belonged, were ever afterwards regarded as one [through this new blood-union].”<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a>
Had these mothers mingled and interchanged their own
blood before the births of their children, the children&mdash;as children of
a common blood&mdash;would have been debarred from marriage; but now
that the two children were covenanting to be one, their mothers might
interchange their blood, that the young couple might have an absolute
equality of family nature.</p>

<p class="indent">There are frequent references by travelers to the rite of brotherhood,
or of close friendship, in one part of the world or another, with or without
a description of its methods. Thus of one of the tribes in Central
Africa it is said: “The Wanyamuezi have a way of making brotherhood,
similar to that which has already been described, except that
instead of drinking each other’s blood, the newly made brothers mix it
[their blood] with butter on a leaf, and exchange leaves. The butter is
then rubbed into the incisions, so that it acts as a healing ointment at
the same time that blood is exchanged.<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> The ceremony is concluded
by tearing the leaves to pieces and showering the fragments on the heads
of the brothers.”<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> The Australians, again, are said to have “the custom
of making ‘<em>Kotaiga</em>,’ or brotherhood, with strangers. When Europeans
visit their districts, and behave as they ought to do, the natives generally
unite themselves in bonds of fellowship with the strangers; each selecting
one of them as his Kotaiga. The new relations are then considered
as having mutual responsibilities, each being bound to forward the welfare
of the other.”<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> Once more, in Feejee, two warriors sometimes bind
themselves to each other by a formal ceremony, and although its details
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
are not described, a missionary writer says of it: “The manner in which
they do this is singular, and wears the appearance of a marriage contract;
and the two men entering into it are spoken of as man and wife,
to indicate the closeness of their military union. By this mutual bond,
the two men pledge themselves to oneness of purpose and effort, to stand
by each other in every danger, defending each other to the death, and
if needful to die together.”<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a></p>

<p class="indent">With the American Indians, there are various traces of the blood-brotherhood
idea. Says Captain Clark, in his work on the Indian Sign
Language: “Among many tribes there are brothers by adoption,
and the tie seems to be held about as sacredly as though created by
nature.”<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> Stephen Powell, writing of the Pacific Coast Indians, gives this
tie of brotherhood-adoption yet more prominence, than does Clark. He
says: “There is an interesting institution found among the Wyandots,
as among some other of our North American tribes, namely, that of
fellowship. Two young men agree to be perpetual friends to each other,
or <em>more than brothers</em>. Each reveals to the other the secrets of his life,
and counsels with him on matters of importance, and defends him from
wrong and violence, and at his death is chief mourner.”<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> This certainly
suggests the relation of blood-brotherhood; whether blood be
intermingled in the consummation of the rite, or not.</p>

<p class="indent">Colonel Dodge tells of a ceremony of Indian-brotherhood, which includes
a bloody rite, worthy of notice in this connection. He says:
“A strong flavor of religious superstition attaches to a scalp, and many
solemn contracts and binding obligations can only be made over or by
means of a scalp;” for is it not the representative of a life? In illustration
of this, he gives an incident which followed an Indian battle, in
which the Pawnees had borne a part with the whites against the
Northern Cheyennes. Colonel Dodge was sitting in his tent, when “the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
acting head-chief of the Pawnees stalked in gravely, and without a
word.” The Colonel continues: “We had long been friends, and had
on several occasions been in tight places together. He sat down on the
side of my bed, looked at me kindly, but solemnly, and began in a low
tone to mutter in his own language, half chant, half recitative. Knowing
that he was making ‘medicine’ [that he was engaged in a religious
exercise] of some kind, I looked on without comment. After some
moments, he stood erect, and stretched out his hand to me. I gave him
my hand. He pulled me into a standing position, embraced me, passed
his hands lightly over my head, face, arms, body, and legs to my feet,
muttering all the while; embraced me again, then turned his back upon
me, and with his face toward heaven, appeared to make adoration. He
then turned to embrace and manipulate me again. After some five
minutes of this performance, he drew from his wallet a package, and
unrolling it, disclosed a freshly taken [and therefore still bloody] scalp
of an Indian. Touching me with this [blood-vehicle] in various places
and ways, he finally drew out his knife, [and ‘cutting the covenant’ in
this way, he] divided the scalp carefully along the part [the seam] of
the hair, and handing me one half, embraced me again, kissing me on
the forehead. ‘Now,’ said he in English, ‘you are my brother.’ He
subsequently informed me that this ceremony could not have been performed
without this scalp.”<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Here seems to be an illustration of cutting the covenant of blood-brotherhood,
by sharing the life of a substitute human victim. It is
much the same in the wild West as in the primitive East.</p>

<p class="indent">So simple a matter as the clasping of hands in token of covenant
fidelity, is explicable, in its universality, only as a vestige of the primitive
custom of joining pierced hands in the covenant of blood-friendship.
Hand-clasping is not, by any means, a universal, nor is it even the commonest,
mode of friendly and fraternal salutation among primitive peoples.
Prostrations, embracings, kissings, nose-rubbings, slappings of one’s own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
body, jumpings up and down, the snappings of one’s fingers, the blowing
of one’s breath, and even the rolling upon one’s back, are all among the
many methods of primitive man’s salutations and obeisances (See, e. g.,
Spencer’s <cite>Principles of Sociology</cite>, II., 16-19). But, even where hand
clasping is unknown in salutation, it is recognized as a symbol of the
closest friendship. Thus, for example, among tribes of North American
Indians where nose-rubbing is the mode of salutation, there is, in their
widely diffused sign language, the sign of clasped, or inter-locked, hands,
as indicative of friendship and union. (<cite>First An. Rep. of Bureau of
Ethnol.</cite>, pp. 385 f., 521, 534 f.) So again, similarly, in Australia (<i>Ibid.</i>,
citation from Smith’s <cite>Aborigines of Victoria</cite>, II., 308). In the Society
Islands, the clasping of hands marks the marriage union, and marks a
loving union between two brothers in arms; although it has no place in
ordinary greetings (Ellis’s <cite>Polyn. Res.</cite>, II., 11, 492, 569). And so,
again, in other primitive lands.</p>

<p class="indent">There seems, indeed, to be a gleam of this thought in Job 17 : 3:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Give now a pledge, be surety for me with thyself;</div>
<div class="verse1">Who is there that will strike hands with me?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Hebrew word <i>taq’a</i><a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a>
(<span lang="he" xml:lang="he">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1506;</span>) here translated “strike,” has also the
meaning “to pierce” (Judg. 4 : 21) and “to blow through,” or “to drive
through” (Num. 10 : 3); and Job’s question might be freely rendered;
Who is there that will pierce [or that will clasp pierced] hands with me,
in blood-friendship? Thus, suretyship grew out of blood-covenanting.</p>

<p class="indent">Again, in Zechariah 13 : 6, where the prophet foretells the moral
reformation of Judah, there is a seeming reference to the pierced hands
of blood-friendship. When one is suspected of being a professional
prophet, by certain marks of cuttings between his hands, he declares that
these are marks of his blood-covenant with his friends. “And one shall
say unto him, What are these wounds [these cuttings] between thine
hands? Then he shall answer, [They are] these [cuttings] with which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
I was wounded [or stricken, or pierced] in the house of my friends [in
the covenant of friendship].” If, indeed, the translation of the Revisers,
“between thine arms,” were justified, the cuttings would still seem to be
the cuttings of the blood-covenant (See pages <a href="#Page_13">13</a>, <a href="#Page_45">45</a>, <i>supra</i>).</p>

<p class="indent">It is a noteworthy fact, that among the Jews in Tunis, near the old
Phœnician settlement of Carthage, the sign of a bleeding hand is still
an honored and a sacred symbol, as if in recognition of the covenant-bond
of their brotherhood and friendship. “What struck me most in all
the houses,” says a traveler (Chevalier de Hesse-Wartegg) among these
Jews, “was the impression of an open bleeding hand, on every wall
of each floor. However white the walls, this repulsive [yet suggestive]
sign was to be seen everywhere.”</p>

<p class="indent">How many times, in the New Testament epistles, does the idea show
itself, of an inter-union of lives, between Christ and his disciples, and between
these disciples and each other. “We, who are many, are one
body in Christ, and severally members one of another” (Rom. 12 : 5).
“We are members of his body” (Eph. 5 : 30). “We are members one
of another” (Eph. 4 : 25). “Know ye not that your bodies are members
of Christ?” (1 Cor. 6 : 15). “Ye are the body of Christ, and
severally [are] members thereof” (1 Cor. 12 : 27).</p>

<p class="indent">It is in this truth of truths, concerning the possibility of an inter-union
of the human life with the divine, through a common inter-bloodflow,
that there is found a satisfying of the noblest heart yearnings of primitive
man everywhere, and of the uttermost spiritual longings of the most advanced
Christian believer, in the highest grade of intellectual and moral
enlightenment. No attainment of evolution, or of development, has brought
man’s latest soul-cry beyond the intimations of his earliest soul-outreaching.</p>

<p>ITS IMPORTANCE AND PROBABLE SITE, WITH THE STORY OF A HUNT

AND THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE HOLY LAND.</p>

<p class="p2 indent"><span class="smcap">From</span> <cite>The Athenæum</cite> (<span class="smcap">London</span>).</p>

<p class="indent">“This book contains a great deal of new information on the topography
of the Holy Land, derived from the latest hieroglyphic documents, as
well as from the accounts of recent travelers.... The wilderness
of Shur (a word meaning a wall) was beyond the Great Wall of Egypt,
and was also, according to the happy conjecture of our author, the
wilderness of Etham. This is an important identification, which will be
a new starting-point for the history of the exodus.”</p>

<p class="p2 indent"><span class="smcap">From</span> <cite>The Academy</cite> (<span class="smcap">London</span>).</p>

<p class="indent">“This is a truly noteworthy book, and will at once command the
attention of all biblical scholars.”</p>

<p class="p2 indent"><span class="smcap">From the</span> <cite>London Quarterly Review</cite>.</p>

<p class="indent">“This is one of the noblest historical monographs that we have, and
in some respects surpasses all other books of the kind.... The
reader will find this work of our American divine deeply engrossing;
combining, in fact, many kinds of interest not often meeting in one
volume. We have a fine historical insight running through all the
ages; a keen appreciation of the difficulties of the exodus, an intelligent
attempt to settle them; an intense enthusiasm for the biblical history as
such, and the dramatic skill of a modern traveler.... It is a book
which our young Hebraists and students of the Old Testament should
read over and over again.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 indent"><span class="smcap">From Professor A. H. Sayce, of Oxford University.</span></p>

<p class="indent">“It is one of the most ‘thorough’ books I have ever come across.
Among other points proved by you, your identification of the desert of
Shur is perhaps the neatest and most important.”</p>

<p class="p2 indent"><span class="smcap">From Professor Dr. <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Franz Delitzsch</span>, of Leipzig University.</span></p>

<p class="indent">“As an apple of Tantalus, your splendid work concerning Kadesh-Barnea
sways above me. I am not yet filled with it; ... but it is
unbearable that I should longer refrain from thanking you.... It
is a great service that you, following the lead of the sainted Palmer, have
made Ên Kudeîs the object of your investigation.... My commentary
on Genesis is out of print.... Would that I could yet
once more work over this commentary.... Then I would have an
opportunity to show my thankful appreciation of your work.”</p>

<p class="p2 indent"><span class="smcap">From Dr. <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hermann Guthe</span> (Secretary of the German Palestine
Society) in the</span> <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Theologische Literatur-Zeitung</cite>, <span class="smcap">of Leipzig</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">“Trumbull appears to me to be specially felicitous in his determination
of the three roads leading out from Egypt to the East, which are of great
importance for the general history of the further East.... The
happy result of his journey is very gratifying, and we have to thank his
diligent studies for a valuable contribution to biblical geography.”</p>

<p class="p2 indent"><span class="smcap">From Professor C. A. Briggs (of Union Theological Seminary)
in</span> <cite>The Presbyterian Review</cite>.</p>

<p class="indent">“This is the most important work upon the geography of the Holy
Land produced in America since the Biblical Researches of Edward
Robinson.... Dr. Trumbull ... has established the site of
Kadesh-Barnea so thoroughly, and so fortified his conclusions on every
hand, that we believe no one will hereafter think of questioning them....
The book is written in an interesting and fervent style. The
author grapples with his reader. His enthusiasm is contagious. The
critic has to take care and stand firm lest he be swept off his feet. We
thank Dr. Trumbull for his labor of love and enthusiasm. He has done
honor to American pluck and indefatigable research. We are proud of
the book and the man.”</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_160_160" id="Footnote_160_160"></a><a href="#FNanchor_160_160"><span class="label">[160]</span></a> This is the rendering of Birch. <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ebers</span> has looked for an
explanation of this gloss, in the rite of circumcision (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ægypten u. d.
Bücher Mose’s</cite>, p. 284 f.); but the primary reference to the “arm” of
the god, and to the union secured through the interflowing blood, point
to the blood-covenant as the employed figure of speech; although
circumcision, as will be seen presently, was likewise a symbol of the
blood-covenant&mdash;for one’s self and for one’s seed. <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Brugsch</span> also sees a
similar meaning, to that suggested by <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ebers</span>, in this reference to the
blood. His rendering of the original text is: “Reach me your hands. I have
become that which ye are” (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Religion u. Mythol. d. alt. Ægypt.</cite>, I.,
219). <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Page Renouf</span>, looking for the symbolisms of <i>material</i> nature
in all these statements, would find here “the crimson of a sunset” in the
“blood which flows from the Sun-god Rā, as he hastens to his suicide”
(<cite>Trans. of Soc. of Bib. Arch.</cite>, Vol. VIII., Part 2, p. 211). This,
however, does not conflict with the <em>spiritual</em> symbolism of oneness
of nature through oneness of blood. And no one of these last three
suggested meanings accounts for the oneness with the gods through blood,
which the deceased claims, unless the symbolism of blood-covenanting be
recognized in the terminology. That symbolism being recognized, the
precise source of the flowing blood becomes a minor matter.</p></div>

<p>This amulet is also called <i>tet</i>; a word of the same phonetic force
as <i>tet</i>, the “arm,” or the “bracelet,” but of different letters.
This word <span class="nobreak">(<img src="images/glyph4a_081.png" class="middle2" alt="inline illustration" />)</span> seems to have the root-idea of “word;” as if it
were applied to the text of the blood-covenant.</p>

<p>The amulet as constructed for the mummy, was stained with the
water or liquid of the tree called <i>ankh am</i> <span class="nobreak">(<img src="images/glyph5a_082.png" class="middle" alt="inline illustration" />)</span>. The
amulet itself, according to <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Brugsch</span>, was also called <i>ankh merer</i>
<span class="nobreak">(<img src="images/glyph6a_082.png" class="middle4" alt="inline illustration" />)</span>. But <em>ankh</em> <span class="nobreak">(<img src="images/glyph7a_082.png" class="middle2" alt="inline illustration" />)</span> means either to <em>live</em>
(the ordinary meaning), or to <em>swear</em>, to <em>make oath</em> (more
rarely), and <em>merer</em> <span class="nobreak">(<img src="images/glyph8a_082.png" class="middle3" alt="inline illustration" />)</span> is a reduplicated form
of <i>mer</i> <span class="nobreak">(<img src="images/glyph9a_082.png" class="middle3" alt="inline illustration" />)</span> <em>to love</em>, <em>love</em>,
<em>friendship</em>. The meaning of <em>ankh merer</em>, as applied to the
blood-amulet may be, oath, or covenant, or pledge of love or friendship.
The word <i>merer</i>, in the compound <i>ankh merer</i>, is followed with
the determinative of the flying scarabæus <span class="nobreak">(<img src="images/glyph10a_082.png" class="middle1" alt="inline illustration" />)</span> which was
commonly placed (<cite>Anc. Egypt.</cite>, III., 346) upon the breast, in lieu
of the heart of the dead (<i>Ibid.</i>, III., 486). See page <a href="#Page_100">100</a>,
<i>infra</i>.</p>

<p>And here the inquiry is suggested, Was the <em>ankh am</em> the same as the
modern <em>henneh</em>? Note the connection of <i>henneh</i> with the
marriage festivities in the East to-day.</p>

<p class="v">“Paint one hand with henna, mother;</p>
<p class="v1">Paint one hand and leave the other.</p>
<p class="v1">Bracelets on the right with henna;</p>
<p class="v1">On the left give drink to henna.”</p>

as also among the Orientals generally, from the days of Jacob
(Gen. 30 : 14-17) until to-day, carried the idea of promoting a loving
union; and the Egyptian name for mandrakes&mdash;<i>tetmut</i>&mdash;combined the
root-word <i>tet</i> already referred to as meaning “arm,” or
“bracelet,” and <i>mut</i>&mdash;with the signification of “attesting,” or
“confirming.” Thus the blood and the mandrake juice would be a true

divinity, is a widely observed custom in the East. Burton tells of the
habit, in Mekkeh, of cutting three parallel gashes down the fleshy cheek
of every male child; and of the claim by some that these gashes “were
signs that the scarred [one] was the servant of Allah’s house”
(<cite>Pilgrimage to Mecca and Medinah</cite>, third ed., p. 456). In India,
there are various methods of receiving such flesh-marks of devotedness.
“One of the most common consists in stamping upon the shoulders,
chest, and other parts of the body, with a red-hot iron, certain marks,
to represent the armor [or livery] of their gods; the impressions of
which are never effaced, but are accounted sacred, and are ostentatiously
displayed as marks of distinctions” (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dubois</span>’s <cite>Des. of Man.
and Cust. in India</cite>, Part III., chap. 3). “From henceforth let no man
trouble me,” says Paul: “for I bear branded on my body the marks
of Jesus” (Gal. 6 : 17).</p></div>

“Baal-bereeth” (see Judges 8 : 33; 9 : 4) seems to have had its centre

Rabbinical literature and of Jewish customs, says, on this point: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cum
deinde compater infantulum in sinu habet jacentem, tum Mohel sive
circumcisor eum è fasciis evolvit, pudendum ejus apprehendit, ejusque
anteriorem partem per cuticulam præputii comprehendit, granulumque
pudendi ejus retrorsum premit; quo facto cuticulam præputii fricat, ut
illa per id emortua infantulus cæsuram tanto minus sentiscat. Deinde
cultellum circumcisorium è pueri astantis manu capit, claraque voce,
Benedictus (inquit) esto tu Deus, Domine noster, Rex mundi, qui nos
mandatis tuis sanctificasti, nobisque pactum circumcisionis dedisti.
Interim dum ille loquitur sic, particulam præputii anteriorem usque eo
abscindit, ut capitellum pudendi nudum conspici queat, illamque
festinanter in patellam arena ista plenam conjicit; puero quoque isti,
à quo acceperat, cultellum reddit circumcisorium; ab alio vero poculum
vino rubro (ceu dictum fuit) impletum, capit; haurit ex eo quantum ore
continere potest, quod mox super infantulum expuit, eoque sanguinem ejus
abluit: in faciem quoque infantuli vini aliquid expuit, si eum viribus
defici conspexerit. Mox pudendum puelli ore comprehendit, et sanguinis
ex eodem quantumcunque potest, exugit, ut sanguis idem tanto citius se
sistat; sanguinem exuctum in alterum poculorum vino rubro refertorum,

rite by which Abraham became the Friend of God. They say (see citations
from the Talmud, in <cite>Nethivoth Olam</cite>, p. 367): “Abraham was not
called perfect before he was circumcised; and because of the merit of
circumcision was the covenant made with him concerning the inheritance
of the Land. It [circumcision] also saves from the punishment
of hell; for our sages have said, that Abraham sits at the gates of hell

counted stronger than the arms, through the training of the people as
runners rather than as burden-bearers, the <em>leg</em> supplies the blood

binding oath, above the grave of the original patriarch of the Passumah.
An animal is sacrificed, cut into small pieces, and cooked in a pot.
“Then he who is to take the oath, holding his hand, or a long kriss of
the finest sort, over the grave-stone, and over the cooked animal, says:
‘If such and such be not the case, may I be afflicted with the worst
evils.’ The whole of the company then partake of the food” (<cite>A
Naturalist’s Wanderings</cite>, p. 198 f.). This seems to be a vestige of
the primitive custom of eating on the witness-heap of an oath.</p></div>

violent palpitation of the heart accompanied with bloody sweat.... Dr.
Millingen’s explanation of bloody sweat ... is judicious. ‘It is
probable,’ says he, ‘that this strange disorder arises from a violent
commotion of the nervous system, turning the streams of blood out of
their natural course, and forcing the red particles into the cutaneous
excretories.’” (Stroud’s <cite>Physical Cause of the Death of Christ</cite>,
pp. 74, 380).</p></div>

distinct covenants, in Oriental practice as well as in biblical teaching;
although this difference has been strangely overlooked by biblical
students in the realm of Orientalisms. The Covenant of Bread is temporary;
the Covenant of Blood is permanent. The one secures a truce; the other
secures a vital union. Symbolically, the one gives nourishment; the
other gives life. The Covenant of Bread is an exhibit and a pledge of
hospitality, and it brings one into family or tribal relations with those
proffering it. The Covenant of Blood is immediately personal and
individual. There seems to be an unconscious trace of this distinction
in the refusal of the Romish Church to include the laity in the
symbolizing of the Covenant of Blood, at the Lord’s table.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
